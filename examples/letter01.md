Dear Doctor,

Thank you for your referral. I saw this pleasant 70 year old man in my clinic today.

He presents with a 1 year history of a lump in his right groin.
History is typical for a right inguinal hernia. This causes minimal symptoms.

He has had a myocardial infarction 5 years ago and has congestive heart failure.
His exercise tolerance is limited to 50 yards.

Clinical examination confirmed a easily reducible right inguinal hernia.

In view of his comorbidities and the lack of symptoms, I have advised against surgery.
He is in agreement with this. I have not made any further arrangements to see him again but will be happy to do so should he become more symptomatic.

Kind regards.

Mr. Smith
