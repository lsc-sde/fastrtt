### Step-by-Step Approach to Building an Agentic Workflow for Automating RTT Pathway Recording and Reporting

Automating Referral to Treatment (RTT) pathway recording and reporting is a challenging task due to the complexity of NHS England's rules (e.g., clock starts/stops, active monitoring, patient-initiated delays, inter-provider transfers), the mix of structured (e.g., timestamps, codes, statuses) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes, letters, outcome sheets) in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and the need for high accuracy to ensure patient safety and compliance. An agentic workflow—using AI agents that can reason, plan, and act autonomously—can streamline this by mimicking human validators but scaling it efficiently.

I'll outline a structured approach below, drawing from the guidance in the provided document (e.g., sections on clock rules, recording, reporting via SDCS/SUS, and data quality). This assumes you're building on a platform like LangChain, CrewAI, or AutoGen for multi-agent systems, integrated with EHR APIs (e.g., via FHIR standards) and the tools available (e.g., code_execution for calculations, browse_page or web_search for external references, search_pdf_attachment for deep dives into the guidance doc). Prioritize ethical AI use: ensure human oversight for clinical decisions, comply with GDPR/NHS data governance, and avoid any automation that could imply disallowed activities (e.g., no hacking or unauthorized access).

#### 1. **Define Scope and Requirements**
   - **Map Key RTT Processes**: Break down the guidance into core components:
     - **Clock Starts (Section 3)**: Triggers like referrals (e.g., GP to consultant-led service), self-referrals, bilateral procedures, or post-active monitoring decisions.
     - **Clock Stops (Section 4)**: For treatment (e.g., first definitive treatment, transplant list addition) or non-treatment (e.g., active monitoring, DNAs, patient declines).
     - **Special Cases**: Patient-initiated delays (Section 8), planned patients (Section 5), interface/community services (Sections 6-7), transfers/subcontracting (Section 11), reporting (Section 10).
     - **Data Elements**: Track mandatory fields like RTT Period Status Codes (Annex D), Patient Pathway Identifiers (PPIDs, Annex C), start/end dates, and statuses (e.g., 10 for first activity, 30 for first treatment).
     - **Reporting Outputs**: Aggregate monthly returns (e.g., via SDCS), including completed/incomplete pathways, 52+ week waiters, and validations (Annex B).
   - **Identify Pain Points**: Human validators manually review EHRs for events (e.g., appointments, notes). Automation should focus on extraction, rule application, and flagging ambiguities for human review.
   - **Success Metrics**: Accuracy (>95% match to manual validation), reduction in processing time, compliance with NHS Constitution (e.g., 18-week standard), and auditability (e.g., explainable decisions).
   - **Constraints**: Use only allowed tools; assume EHR data is accessible via APIs (no direct hacking). Start with a pilot on non-sensitive, anonymized data.

#### 2. **Data Ingestion and Preparation**
   - **Sources**:
     - **Structured Data**: EHR databases (e.g., timestamps for referrals/appointments, RTT status codes, PPIDs, admission dates).
     - **Unstructured Data**: Clinical notes, letters, outcome sheets (e.g., PDFs or text in EHR).
     - **Guidance Doc**: Use as a knowledge base—treat the attached "rtt-guidance-feb-25.md" as a PDF attachment for tools like `search_pdf_attachment` or `browse_pdf_attachment` to query specific sections (e.g., query: "rules for clock starts following DNA").
   - **Ingestion Strategy**:
     - Integrate EHR APIs to pull patient records in batches (e.g., daily for active pathways).
     - Use OCR/NLP for unstructured data if needed (simulate via `view_image` for scanned docs or `code_execution` with libraries like PyPDF2 in Python).
     - Preprocess: Normalize dates, map local codes to standard RTT statuses (Annex D), and create a unified patient timeline (e.g., sequence of events per PPID).
   - **Tool Usage**: For initial analysis, call `search_pdf_attachment` with queries like file_name="rtt-guidance-feb-25.md", query="clock start rules", mode="keyword" to extract rules. Use `code_execution` to parse and structure the output (e.g., into a JSON ruleset).

#### 3. **Design the Agentic Architecture**
   - **Multi-Agent System**: RTT involves sequential reasoning (e.g., detect start → apply rules → validate stop), so use a multi-agent setup over a single agent for modularity and error-handling.
     - **Extractor Agent**: Parses EHR data to build a patient timeline. Inputs: Patient ID/PPID. Outputs: Chronological events (e.g., referral received date, appointments, notes).
       - Tools: `search_pdf_attachment` for guidance lookups, `code_execution` for timeline sorting (e.g., Python script to filter events by date).
     - **Rule Applicator Agent**: Applies RTT rules to the timeline. E.g., Check if a referral starts a clock (Rule 1-3), identify stops (Rule 4-5), handle DNAs/delays.
       - Tools: `code_execution` for calculations (e.g., weeks waited = (current_date - start_date) / 7), `web_search` for clarifying ambiguous terms (e.g., "definition of active monitoring").
     - **Validator Agent**: Cross-checks against guidance and flags inconsistencies (e.g., "Clock start after DNA nullified original clock?"). Simulates human validation.
       - Tools: `browse_page` for external NHS resources (e.g., url="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/", instructions="Extract latest validation checks").
     - **Reporter Agent**: Aggregates data for SDCS/SUS submissions (e.g., incomplete pathways, 52+ week waiters). Generates reports/tables.
       - Tools: `code_execution` for aggregations (e.g., Pandas to sum pathways by time-band), `render_inline_citation` for sourcing claims from searches.
     - **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates the others, handles loops (e.g., if ambiguity, query more data), and escalates to humans (e.g., via alerts).
   - **Reasoning Framework**: Use chain-of-thought prompting for agents (e.g., "Step 1: Identify referral date. Step 2: Check if it meets Rule 1..."). Incorporate few-shot examples from the guidance's case studies.
   - **State Management**: Use a shared memory (e.g., database) to track workflow state per patient (e.g., current RTT status).

#### 4. **Implementation and Iteration**
   - **Prototype**: Start small—automate one subprocess (e.g., clock starts for new referrals). Use synthetic data based on guidance examples (Sections 3-4).
     - Example Workflow: Input patient EHR snippet → Extractor builds timeline → Rule Applicator computes wait time → Validator checks vs. 18-week rule → Reporter outputs status.
   - **Integration**:
     - EHR: Use FHIR/HL7 APIs for real-time pulls.
     - Tools: Parallel calls for efficiency (e.g., multiple `x_keyword_search` for X ecosystem if needed for real-time updates, but unlikely here).
     - External: If needed, `web_search_with_snippets` for updates (query="NHS RTT guidance updates post-2025").
   - **Error Handling**: Agents should flag uncertainties (e.g., ambiguous notes) and route to human review. Use thresholds (e.g., confidence <80% → escalate).
   - **Testing**:
     - Unit Tests: Per agent (e.g., does Rule Applicator correctly handle bilateral procedures?).
     - End-to-End: Simulate 100 pathways; compare to manual validation.
     - Compliance: Audit logs for every decision, citing guidance sections.
   - **Iteration**: Use feedback loops—log discrepancies, retrain agents on resolved cases. Monitor for biases (e.g., in unstructured data parsing).

#### 5. **Deployment and Governance**
   - **Phased Rollout**: Pilot in one department (e.g., orthopaedics), then scale. Integrate with existing systems (e.g., PAS for PPIDs).
   - **Human-in-the-Loop**: Always require clinician sign-off for clock stops/treatments; agents assist, not decide.
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Ensure no PII exposure; comply with NHS DSPT. Avoid over-reliance—use for 80% routine cases, manual for complex.
   - **Monitoring**: Track metrics post-deployment (e.g., error rates, time saved). Use `code_execution` for dashboards (e.g., Matplotlib plots of wait distributions).
   - **Costs/Resources**: Start with open-source (e.g., Llama models), estimate API calls (e.g., limit `web_search` to essentials).

This approach leverages the guidance's structure while making the workflow modular and scalable. If you provide sample EHR data or specific subprocesses, I can refine this further (e.g., prototype a code snippet via `code_execution`).
