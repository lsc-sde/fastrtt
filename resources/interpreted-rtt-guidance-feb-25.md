## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Background

**Why waiting times matter:**
- Waiting times are crucial to patients who want to be referred, diagnosed and treated as soon as possible
- Patients use RTT information to make informed choices about where to be referred and understand expected waiting times
- NHS providers and commissioners use this data to ensure compliance with patients' legal right to start consultant-led non-emergency treatment within a maximum of 18 weeks from referral¬π

**Historical context:**
In 2015, NHS England produced refreshed guidance to consolidate and simplify previous published guidance and related advice¬≤.

In June 2015, following a recommendation from Sir Bruce Keogh¬≥, the incomplete pathway operational standard became the sole measure of patients' constitutional right to start treatment within 18 weeks. This resulted in the removal of the completed admitted pathway operational standard.

**Key changes from 2015:**
- ‚ùå **Removed:** Requirement to report pauses or suspensions in RTT waiting time clocks in monthly RTT returns
- ‚ùå **Removed:** Requirement to submit admitted adjusted data to NHS England
- ‚úÖ **Retained:** Unadjusted admitted and non-admitted completed pathway data (no longer used for monitoring operational standards)
- ‚úÖ **Retained:** Incomplete pathway data requirements (always been unadjusted submission)
- ‚ûï **Added:** Two new data items - incomplete pathways for patients with a decision to admit for treatment and new RTT periods

**Patient choice accommodation:**
The 2015 refresh emphasized that patients who choose to wait longer should have their wishes accommodated without penalty. The 8% tolerance for the incomplete pathway waiting time operational standard accounts for:

- üî∏ **Personal choice:** Patients who choose to wait longer for personal or social reasons
- üî∏ **Clinical appropriateness:** Patients for whom it is clinically appropriate to wait longer (excludes clinically complex patients who can and should start treatment within 18 weeks)
- üî∏ **Non-attendance:** Patients who fail to attend agreed appointments

> **Note:** In some situations, a clock stop for active monitoring may be appropriate for patients choosing to wait longer.

**Recent updates (January 2025):**
Updated to reflect NHS England's revised guidance on patients who choose to wait longer. The aim is to help providers:
- Manage waiting lists and resources more accurately and efficiently
- Focus on arranging treatment for patients who have been waiting a long time and are available
- Continue protecting patients' rights to choose

**Fundamental principle:**
> All decisions about a patient's waiting time should be made with the patient's best clinical interests in mind and in accordance with national legally binding RTT Rules‚Å∂.

**Key stakeholders responsible for this guidance:**

| Stakeholder | Responsibility |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Referrers** | Advise patients on waiting times at different providers; raise awareness of maximum waiting time rights |
| **Service managers and commissioners** | Ensure reported data accurately reflects waiting times; assess standard delivery; identify areas needing action |
| **Hospital staff** | Record and report accurate, high-quality waiting times data |
| **Chief executives / Chief operating officers** | Primary responsibility for ensuring accurate waiting time data submission to NHS England‚Åπ |

### 1.2 Promoting Equality and Addressing Health Inequalities

Promoting equality and addressing health inequalities are at the heart of NHS England's values. Throughout the development of the policies and processes cited in this document, we have:

- Given due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation
- Advanced equality of opportunity
- Fostered good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not

We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of implementing the policies and processes set out in this document and will consider what further action might be required to advance equality and reduce health inequalities.

## 2. National Clock Rules (from October 2015)

### 2.1 General Principles

> **Core Principle:** Once a referral to treatment (RTT) waiting time clock has started it continues to tick until:
> - ‚úÖ **The patient starts first definitive treatment**
> - **OR**
> - ‚úÖ **A clinical decision is made that stops the clock or the patient declines treatment**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Providers should ensure that all clock stops without treatment are made in the best clinical interest of the patient and are not influenced by the impact on incomplete pathway waiting time performance.

### 2.2 Referral to Treatment Consultant-Led Waiting Times Rules Suite

#### üü¢ Clock Starts

**Rule 1:** A waiting time clock starts when any care professional or service permitted by an English NHS commissioner to make such referrals, refers to:

- **a)** A consultant-led service, regardless of setting, with the intention that the patient will be assessed and, if appropriate, treated before responsibility is transferred back to the referring health professional or general practitioner
- **b)** An interface or referral management or assessment service, which may result in an onward referral to a consultant-led service before responsibility is transferred back to the referring health professional or general practitioner

**Rule 2:** A waiting time clock also starts upon a self-referral by a patient to the above services, where these pathways have been agreed locally by commissioners and providers and once the referral is ratified by a care professional permitted to do so.

**Rule 3:** Upon completion of a consultant-led referral to treatment period, a new waiting time clock only starts:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **a) Bilateral procedures** | When a patient becomes fit and ready for the second of a consultant-led bilateral procedure |
| **b) New/different treatment** | Upon the decision to start a substantively new or different treatment that does not already form part of that patient's agreed care plan |
| **c) Re-referral** | Upon a patient being re-referred into a consultant-led; interface; or referral management or assessment service as a new referral |
| **d) Active monitoring** | When a decision to treat is made following a period of active monitoring |
| **e) DNA rebooking** | When a patient rebooks their appointment following a first appointment Did Not Attend (DNA) that stopped and nullified their earlier clock |

#### üî¥ Clock Stops

##### Clock Stops for Treatment (Rule 4)

A clock stops when:

**a) First definitive treatment starts.** This could be:
- i. Treatment provided by an interface service
- ii. Treatment provided by a consultant-led service
- iii. Therapy or healthcare science intervention provided in secondary care or at an interface service, if this is what the consultant-led or interface service decides is the best way to manage the patient's disease, condition or injury and avoid further interventions

**b) Clinical decision for transplant list:** A clinical decision is made and has been communicated to the patient, and subsequently their GP and/or other referring practitioner without undue delay, to add a patient to a transplant list.

##### Clock Stops for 'Non-Treatment' (Rule 5)

A waiting time clock stops when it is communicated to the patient, and subsequently their GP and/or other referring practitioner without undue delay that:

| Stop Reason | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **a) Return to primary care** | It is clinically appropriate to return the patient to primary care for any non consultant-led treatment in primary care |
| **b) Active monitoring** | A clinical decision is made to start a period of active monitoring |
| **c) Patient declines** | A patient declines treatment having been offered it |
| **d) Clinical decision not to treat** | A clinical decision is made not to treat |
| **e) First appointment DNA** | A patient DNAs their first appointment following the initial referral that started their waiting time clock, provided that the provider can demonstrate that the appointment was clearly communicated to the patient¬π‚Å∞ |
| **f) Subsequent DNA with discharge** | A patient DNAs any other appointment and is subsequently discharged back to the care of their GP (see conditions below) |

**Conditions for DNA discharge (option f):**
- ‚úÖ The provider can demonstrate that the appointment was clearly communicated to the patient
- ‚úÖ Discharging the patient is not contrary to their best clinical interests
- ‚úÖ Discharging the patient is carried out according to local, publicly available/published, policies on DNAs
- ‚úÖ These local policies are clearly defined and specifically protect the clinical interests of vulnerable patients (e.g. children) and are agreed with clinicians, commissioners, patients and other relevant stakeholders

> **Note¬π‚Å∞:** DNAs for a first appointment following the initial referral that started a waiting time clock nullify the patient's clock (removed from numerator and denominator for RTT measurement purposes).

## 3. Recording RTT Waiting Times: Clock Starts

### 3.1 Relevant Sections of RTT Rules Suite¬π¬π

Rules 1, 2 and 3 of the Rules Suite set out the rules and definitions relating to RTT clock starts. The accompanying text including case studies 1-22 provide further information to support the NHS on how to apply the national waiting times rules relating to clock starts locally.

> **Note:** This guidance is written from the point of view of RTT data reporting via the Strategic Data Collection Service portal (SDCS); see Annex E for more detail on Referral to Treatment period status in Commissioning Data Sets (CDS) submitted through SUS.

### 3.2 RTT Clock Starts ‚Äì Rule 1

#### üìã Core Definition

**Rule 1:** A waiting time clock starts when any care professional or service permitted by an English NHS commissioner to make such referrals, refers to:

- **a)** A consultant-led service, regardless of setting, with the intention that the patient will be assessed and, if appropriate, treated before responsibility is transferred back to the referring health professional or general practitioner
- **b)** An interface or referral management or assessment service, which may result in an onward referral to a consultant-led service before responsibility is transferred back to the referring health professional or general practitioner

#### üè• Applicable Organizations

Any organisation or service that receives referrals that fall into the criteria above will need to capture information about these patients and submit Waiting List Minimum Data Set (WLMDS) and an RTT monthly return. This includes:

- ‚úÖ Acute trusts
- ‚úÖ Specialist trusts
- ‚úÖ Mental health trusts
- ‚úÖ Any other provider of consultant-led services for NHS patients in England including Independent Sector providers
- ‚úÖ Providers of interface services (as defined in section 6)

#### 3.2.1 Clock Start Date

The RTT clock start date is defined as **the date that the provider receives notice of the referral**. This date needs to be recorded so that the RTT waiting time of the patient can start to be tracked.

##### NHS e-Referral Service (formerly Choose and Book)

For NHS e-Referral Service referrals, the clock start date is **the date that the patient converts their UBRN (Unique Booking Reference Number)**, including where the referral is rejected by the chosen provider and the patient is subsequently re-referred.

**Special case - No appointments available:**
- When no appointments are available at the patient's chosen provider at the time they convert their UBRN
- Their referral is deferred to the provider
- The UBRN will immediately appear on that provider's Appointment Slot Issue (ASI) work list
- **Clock start date:** The date the UBRN appears on this work list
- If there has been any previous activity against the UBRN (e.g., booking into Clinical Assessment Service), the **earlier date** starts the consultant-led RTT clock

##### Non-NHS e-Referral Service

For referrals not made via NHS e-Referral Service, the clock starts on **the date the referral is received by the provider organisation**.

#### üîÑ Inter-Provider Referrals

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** It is important that clock starts can be accurately identified for all patients on an RTT pathway, including pathways that involve more than one provider organisation.

- Providers must identify all inter-provider referrals clearly
- The clock start date for these referrals will **NOT** be the date subsequent providers receive the referral (see section 11)

#### üìä Reporting Requirements

- ‚úÖ All pathways reported should have a known clock start
- ‚úÖ Patients with no known clock start should still be reported
- ‚úÖ It is the responsibility of the receiving provider to take appropriate action to identify a correct start date (may include discussion with the patient)

#### 3.2.2 Referral Management Services (Interface Services, Assessment Services)

For RTT pathways that start within an interface service (all arrangements that incorporate any intermediary levels of clinical triage, assessment and treatment between traditional primary and secondary care):

> **Correct clock start date:** The date that the interface service received the original GP referral **NOT** the date that the onward referral from the interface service was received by the secondary care provider.

Please see section 6 for a full definition of interface services and more information on how RTT applies to these services.

##### NHS e-Referral Service via Interface Service

**Two UBRN scenario:**
- NHS e-Referral Service patients referred to secondary care via an interface service may have two UBRNs associated with the same pathway
- When a second UBRN is created along the same RTT period, it will be linked with the first UBRN
- **Clock start date:** Date of conversion of the **first UBRN**
- The RTT clock keeps ticking whilst the patient converts the second UBRN
- Interface service should monitor Worklists to ensure patients book their second onward appointment in a timely manner
- **Pathway identifier:** The first UBRN (not the second UBRN)

**Paper to e-Referral scenario:**
- GP refers to interface service via paper referral (not NHS e-Referral Service)
- Interface service refers on to Provider using NHS e-Referral Service
- **Clock start:** UBRN conversion date would **NOT** be the RTT start
- Inter Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS) should be attached with the NHS e-Referral Service referral
- This allows the receiving provider to obtain the correct start date (date original GP referral was received by interface service) - see section 11

### 3.3 Clock Starts for Self-Referrals ‚Äì Rule 2

**Rule 2:** A waiting time clock also starts upon a self-referral by a patient to the above services, where these pathways have been agreed locally by commissioners and providers and once the referral is ratified by a care professional permitted to do so.

üìã **Process:**
- RTT clock starts upon a self-referral by a patient that fulfils the criteria above to any service covered by RTT measurement
- **Clock start date:** The date that the self-referral is received by the provider

### 3.4 Other Clock Starts ‚Äì Rule 3

**Rule 3:** Upon completion of a consultant-led referral to treatment period, a new waiting time clock only starts in the following five situations:

| Situation | Clock Start Trigger |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **a) Bilateral procedures** | When a patient becomes fit and ready for the second of a consultant-led bilateral procedure |
| **b) New/different treatment** | Upon the decision to start a substantively new or different treatment that does not already form part of that patient's agreed care plan |
| **c) Re-referral** | Upon a patient being re-referred into a consultant-led; interface; or referral management or assessment service as a new referral |
| **d) Active monitoring** | When a decision to treat is made following a period of active monitoring |
| **e) DNA rebooking** | When a patient rebooks their appointment following a first appointment DNA that stopped and nullified their earlier clock |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirement:** Organisations must be able to capture RTT clock starts in all five situations described above.

#### 3.4.1 Bilateral Procedures

**Definition:** A bilateral procedure is 'a procedure that is carried out on both sides of the body, at matching anatomical sites'.

**Examples:** Cataract removals and joint replacements

**Process:**
1. **First bilateral procedure:**
   - Has its own RTT clock
   - Clock stops on the date the procedure is carried out (or admission date for inpatient/day case)
2. **Second bilateral procedure:**
   - New clock starts when patient becomes fit and ready for the second bilateral procedure

#### 3.4.2 Treatment That Did Not Form Part of the Patient's Original Treatment Plan

**When a new clock starts:**
- Where further (substantively new or different) treatment may be required that did not form part of the patient's original treatment plan
- Includes situations where less intensive treatment has failed, and more aggressive treatment is necessary for the same condition (if the additional treatment did not form part of the patient's agreed care plan)

**Clock start timing:**
- **Usually:** At the point the subsequent decision to treat is made and communicated to the patient
- **Alternative:** Where a patient is referred for diagnostics or specialist opinion with a view to treatment, it may be more appropriate to start the new clock at the onward referral date

**Same vs. Different Provider:**

| Scenario | Clock Start Date |
|----------|------------------|
| **Same consultant or different consultant within same provider** | Date of decision to refer = date referral received |
| **Different provider** | Date referral is received by receiving provider |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** When referring to a different provider, there should not be a significant delay between the date the decision to refer was made (and communicated to the patient) and the date that the referral is received by the receiving provider.

**Clinical outcome sheets requirement:**
- A clock start of this type can occur at any follow-up outpatient appointment including routine follow-up of patients with long-term conditions
- Therefore, clinical outcome sheets should be used for **all** outpatient appointments and not just those for patients on an RTT pathway
- Further information on clinical outcome sheets: see Annex D

#### 3.4.3 Re-referred Patients

Where a patient who has already been on a consultant-led treatment pathway is subsequently referred back into that service as a new referral, this will start a new RTT clock.

#### 3.4.4 Clock Start Following Active Monitoring

**Active monitoring process:**
1. **Clock stops:** When patient commences a period of monitoring in secondary care or at an interface service without clinical intervention or diagnostic procedures at that stage
2. **New clock starts:** If, subsequently (perhaps at a follow-up outpatient appointment), a decision to treat is made - new RTT clock starts from the date that decision is made and communicated to the patient

**Patient-initiated delays through active monitoring:**
- Clinicians may wish to stop a patient's waiting time clock if the patient wishes to delay their pathway, through placing them into a period of active monitoring
- **When patient ready to proceed:** Provider should offer a new date acting as if the patient is on the waiting list at the point which they previously left
- ‚úÖ Patient should **NOT** be returned to the beginning of the waiting list
- üîÑ Patient will have a **new clock start** at the date of decision to go ahead following active monitoring

**Alternative clock start timing:**
- In some cases it may be appropriate to start a new clock **before** a 'decision to treat' is made
- Example: Decision to refer a patient for diagnostics/specialist opinion with a view to starting treatment

**Clinical outcome sheets requirement:**
- Clock start can occur at any follow-up outpatient appointment including routine follow-up of patients with long-term conditions
- Therefore, clinical outcome sheets should be used for **all** outpatient appointments and not just those for patients on an RTT pathway
- See Annex D for more information on clinical outcome sheets

#### 3.4.5 Clock Start Following DNA (Does Not Attend) for First Appointment

**DNA process for first appointments:**

1. **Clock nullification:** If a patient DNAs their first appointment following the initial referral that started their RTT clock, provided that the provider can demonstrate that the appointment was clearly communicated to the patient, this will stop and nullify the RTT clock (removed from numerator and denominator for RTT measurement purposes)

2. **Rebooking scenarios:**
   - **Patient contacts to rebook:** If the patient subsequently contacts the trust to rebook their first appointment, this starts a new RTT clock on the date the patient contacts the trust
   - **Clinician decision to rebook:** If the clinician indicates another first appointment should be offered before the patient contacts the trust, a new RTT clock starts on the date this decision is made
   - **Capacity constraints:** If it's not possible to book an appointment due to capacity pressures or lack of available slots, the clock should still start from the decision to offer another appointment and the patient should be added to a waiting list

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If the patient has had one or more previous RTT periods for the same condition, ensure the new clock start is identified and not linked to a previous RTT start date. Please refer to Annex C.

## 4. Recording RTT Waiting Times: Clock Stops

### 4.1 Relevant Sections of RTT Rules Suite¬π¬≤

Rules 4 and 5 of the Rules Suite set out the rules and definitions relating to RTT clock stops. The accompanying text including case studies 23-28 provide further information to support the NHS on how to apply the national waiting times rules relating to clock stops locally.

### 4.2 Capturing RTT Clock Stops

‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirement:** Organisations must be able to capture RTT clock stops in the situations described in the national clock rules. Please refer to Annex D for technical details on capturing and recording clock stops.

### 4.3 RTT Clock Stops for Treatment (Rule 4)

#### üü¢ Clock Stops for Treatment

**Rule 4:** A clock stops when:

**a) First definitive treatment starts.** This could be:
- i. Treatment provided by an interface service
- ii. Treatment provided by a consultant-led service
- iii. Therapy or healthcare science intervention provided in secondary care or at an interface service, if this is what the consultant-led or interface service decides is the best way to manage the patient's disease, condition or injury and avoid further interventions

**b) Transplant list addition:** A clinical decision is made and has been communicated to the patient, and subsequently their GP and/or other referring practitioner without undue delay, to add a patient to a transplant list.

#### 4.3.1 First Definitive Treatment

> **Definition:** First definitive treatment is 'an intervention intended to manage a patient's disease, condition or injury and avoid further intervention'.

#### 4.3.2 Capturing Clock Stops for Treatment

##### 4.3.2.1 Clock Stops for Treatment in Interface Services

**Interface service definition:** Any arrangement that incorporates any intermediary levels of clinical triage, assessment and treatment between traditional primary and secondary care (see section 6 for more information).

**Clock stop scenarios:**

| Scenario | Clock Stop Action |
|----------|------------------|
| **Interface service provides first definitive treatment** | Clock stops on date first definitive treatment starts within interface service |
| **No treatment required or primary care treatment** | Clock stops on date decision is made and communicated to patient |
| **Referred on to consultant-led service** | RTT clock continues to tick until patient is treated (or decision made that no treatment required) |
| **Referred to non consultant-led service for treatment** | RTT clock continues until first definitive treatment starts within this service |

**Commissioning responsibility:** The organisation that commissions the interface service is responsible for ensuring correct recording and reporting of RTT waiting times for all relevant patients by all relevant providers.

**Data capture requirements:**
- Business process and systems should capture RTT clock stops within interface service
- May be achieved using clinical outcome sheets for all attendances
- Further guidance on clinical outcome sheets: see Annex D

##### 4.3.2.2 Clock Stops for Treatment in Outpatients or Other Consultant-Led Services

- **Method:** Use of clinical outcome sheets enables these clock stops to be captured
- **Clock stop date:** Date of appointment at which first definitive treatment started
- **Reference:** Further information on clinical outcome sheets in Annex D

##### 4.3.2.3 Clock Stops for Treatment as Inpatient/Day Case

**General rule:** An inpatient or day case admission for a patient on an RTT pathway will generally signify a clock stop.

**‚ùå Exceptions (following scenarios would NOT stop the clock):**
- Patient admitted for diagnostic test or procedure only
- Patient admitted for pre-treatment prior to first definitive treatment
- Patient admitted for pre-op assessment only
- Patient admitted for first definitive treatment but intended procedure is not carried out during admission

> **Note:** Where any of the above scenarios occur and a decision is taken that no definitive admitted treatment is needed, this would constitute a non-admitted clock stop, not an admitted one.

**Additional considerations:**
- Some admissions are for patients not on RTT pathway (e.g., emergency admissions from A&E, regular planned admissions for dialysis)

**Identification requirements:**
1. Is the patient on an RTT pathway?
2. Is the admission for first definitive treatment?

**Clinical coding timing:**
- Once clinical coding takes place, possible to definitively identify which admissions are diagnostic only
- Clinical coding may not be timely enough for RTT measurement purposes
- Business processes should be put in place to identify diagnostic admissions

**Clock stop timing:**
- **For inpatient/day case admissions for first definitive treatment:** Clock stops on admission date
- **Rationale:** Recognised that treatment may not start until day after admission (or later), but for simplicity and pragmatism, clock stop recorded as admission date

**Treatment not carried out scenarios:**

| Example | Clock Stop Action |
|---------|------------------|
| **Surgery cancelled - lack of theatre availability** | RTT clock should NOT stop until day of admission when surgery eventually carried out |
| **Surgery cancelled - patient temporarily unfit** | RTT clock should NOT stop until day of admission when surgery eventually carried out |
| **Patient not clinically suitable after admission** | Non-admitted clock stop when clinical decision not to treat is made and communicated to patient |

##### 4.3.2.4 Clock Stops Due to Patient Being Added to Transplant List

**Process:**
- Clinical decision made to add patient to transplant list (matched transplants) stops RTT clock
- **Clock stop date:** Date decision is made and communicated to patient
- **Communication:** Patient's GP and/or other referring practitioner should be informed without undue delay

**Data capture:**
- Likely to occur during outpatient appointment
- Use clinical outcome sheets to capture these clock stops
- **Clock stop date:** Date of appointment at which decision was made and communicated to patient
- See section 1.2 of accompanying Frequently Asked Questions document for more detail

### 4.4 RTT Clock Stops for 'Non-Treatment' (Rule 5)

#### üî¥ Clock Stops for 'Non-Treatment'

**Rule 5:** A waiting time clock stops when it is communicated to the patient, and subsequently their GP and/or other referring practitioner without undue delay that:

| Stop Reason | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **a) Return to primary care** | It is clinically appropriate to return the patient to primary care for any non consultant-led treatment in primary care |
| **b) Active monitoring** | A clinical decision is made to start a period of active monitoring |
| **c) Patient declines treatment** | A patient declines treatment having been offered it |
| **d) Clinical decision not to treat** | A clinical decision is made not to treat |
| **e) First appointment DNA** | A patient DNAs their first appointment following the initial referral that started their waiting time clock, provided that the provider can demonstrate that the appointment was clearly communicated to the patient |
| **f) Subsequent DNA with discharge** | A patient DNAs any other appointment and is subsequently discharged back to the care of their GP (see conditions below) |

**Conditions for DNA discharge (option f):**
- ‚úÖ Provider can demonstrate appointment was clearly communicated to patient
- ‚úÖ Discharging patient is not contrary to their best clinical interests
- ‚úÖ Discharging patient is carried out according to local, publicly available/published policies on DNAs
- ‚úÖ Local policies are clearly defined and specifically protect clinical interests of vulnerable patients (e.g. children) and are agreed with clinicians, commissioners, patients and other relevant stakeholders

#### 4.4.1 Capturing Decisions That Stop an RTT Clock for 'Non-Treatment'

##### 4.4.1.1 Decisions in Outpatients That Stop an RTT Clock

Clinical decisions made during outpatient appointments may stop an RTT clock without treatment. These include the four described at a) to d) above:

- **a)** Clinically appropriate to return patient to primary care for non consultant-led treatment
- **b)** Clinical decision to start period of active monitoring
- **c)** Patient declines all treatment having been offered it
- **d)** Clinical decision not to treat

**Data capture:**
- These decisions should be captured on clinical outcome sheet
- **Clock stop date:** Date decision is made and communicated to patient (date of outpatient attendance)
- See Annex D for further information on clinical outcome sheets

##### 4.4.1.2 Clock Stops Outside Outpatient Attendance or Inpatient Admission

Although majority of clinical decisions take place during consultations with patient present, some do not.

**Examples of non-attendance decisions:**

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Normal test results** | Patient attends diagnostic test. Results normal, no further treatment required. Information communicated via telephone call or letter |
| **Patient declines after listing** | Patient attends first outpatient, added to inpatient waiting list, then calls days later to cancel and decline treatment |
| **Patient death** | Patient on RTT pathway dies and relative informs hospital |

**Data capture methods:**
- Non-outpatient clinical outcomes may be captured using outcome sheets
- Clock stops from administrative events recorded on patient administration systems¬π¬≥
- **Clock stop date:** Date decision is made, which should be date discussed with or communicated to patient

##### 4.4.1.3 Clock Stops for DNAs (Did Not Attend)

> **Good practice:** Providers should have publicly available access policies setting out the application of waiting time rules and the role, rights and responsibilities¬π‚Å¥ of the NHS and patients.

**DNA definition:** A DNA (Did Not Attend, sometimes known as FTA/Failed to Attend, or WNB/Was Not Brought) is where a patient fails to attend an appointment/admission without prior notice.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Patients who rearrange their appointments in advance (irrespective of how short the notice period) should NOT be classed as a DNA.

**First appointment DNA:**
- If patient DNAs first appointment following initial referral that started RTT clock
- Provided provider can demonstrate appointment was clearly communicated to patient
- This will **nullify** the RTT clock (removed from numerator and denominator for RTT measurement)

**Subsequent appointment DNA:**
- Patient DNAs at any other point on RTT pathway will **NOT** stop RTT clock
- **Exception:** Unless patient is being discharged back to care of their GP
- Discharging the patient will stop clock provided criteria are fulfilled (see conditions above)

**Clock stop date:** If criteria fulfilled, RTT clock stops on date patient is discharged back to care of their GP.

**Local DNA policies requirements:**
- Providers should agree and publish local DNA policies in line with guidance spirit
- Example: 'Two strikes and out' policy applied without satisfying criteria would NOT be acceptable

**Policy application examples:**

**For first appointments on RTT pathway:**
- **DNA with nullification:** Patient DNAs, RTT clock stopped and nullified on date of DNA'd appointment (having fulfilled criteria)
- **DNA with rebooking:** Patient DNAs but provider chooses to rebook - original RTT clock stopped and nullified on DNA date, new clock starts at zero on date provider decides to offer another appointment

**For subsequent appointments on RTT pathway:**
- **DNA with discharge:** Patient DNAs and provider returns patient to primary care (having fulfilled criteria) - RTT clock stops on date of DNA'd appointment
- **DNA with rebooking:** Patient DNAs but provider chooses to rebook - existing RTT clock continues to tick

**Policy requirements:**
- Local DNA policies must be clearly defined and published
- Must specifically protect clinical interests of vulnerable patients (e.g. children)
- Must be agreed with clinicians, commissioners, patients and other relevant stakeholders
- No blanket rules that don't account for individual patient circumstances
- For clinicians to determine whether discharging patient is contrary to patient's healthcare needs

##### 4.4.1.4 Clock Stops for Active Monitoring

**Definition and process:**
- RTT clock may be stopped where clinically appropriate to start period of monitoring in secondary care without further clinical intervention or diagnostic procedures at that stage
- **Clock stop date:** Date clinical decision is made and communicated with patient
- **New clock start:** When decision to treat is made following period of active monitoring

**Alternative pathways:**
- Where clinically inappropriate to continue treating patient at that stage, but appropriate to discharge to primary care for ongoing management
- This constitutes decision not to treat and should be recorded as such (stops RTT clock)

**Application scope:**
- Active monitoring may apply at any point in patient's pathway
- Definition carefully drawn up with input from national clinical leads
- Designed to ensure national measurement reflects realities of clinical decision-making

**New treatment scenarios:**
- If during active monitoring, decision made to start substantively new or different treatment that doesn't form part of patient's agreed care plan
- New RTT clock would start on date decision is made and communicated with patient

**Hospital-initiated active monitoring reasons:**

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clinical appropriateness** | Most clinically appropriate option is for patient to be actively monitored over time, rather than undergo further tests, treatments or clinical interventions |
| **Patient delays pathway** | Patient wishes to delay pathway and declines 2 offers of reasonable¬π‚Åµ dates - clinician may decide to start active monitoring following clinical conversation and patient agreement |
| **Alternative provider refusal** | Patient declines 2 reasonable offers of dates for earlier appointment/admission at alternative provider - clinician may decide to start active monitoring following clinical conversation and patient agreement |

**Patient unavailability considerations:**
- Where patient declares period of unavailability (e.g., teacher wishes to wait until school holidays)
- May not be appropriate to offer specific dates within this period
- Active monitoring should not be considered unless 2 reasonable dates could have been offered during declared unavailability period

**Alternative provider requirements:**
- Before offering dates at alternative provider, trust should determine it would be clinically and socially appropriate
- Reasonable alternative provider should be agreed case-by-case, recognising geographical and social factors
- Offers must state details of date, provider and team
- Pragmatic application of active monitoring guidance encouraged

**Patient-initiated active monitoring:**
- Patients may initiate active monitoring (e.g., choosing to decline treatment to see how they cope with symptoms)
- When patients decide to delay pathway, there should be clinical oversight
- Steps should be taken to ensure patient fully understands clinical implications of delay
- Throughout agreed active monitoring period, patient should be advised of process to follow if they wish to go ahead with treatment and be reinstated on waiting list
- Once patient wishes to proceed, provider should offer new date, acting as if patient is on waiting list at point they previously left

**Implementation considerations:**
- Stopping patient's clock for active monitoring requires careful consideration case-by-case
- Use needs to be consistent with patient's perception of their wait
- Example: Stopping clock to actively monitor patient knowing some diagnostic or clinical intervention required in couple of days unlikely to make sense to patient
- More appropriate where longer period of active monitoring required before further action needed

**Patient 'thinking time':**

**Short thinking time:**
- Where patient given 'thinking time'¬π‚Å∂ by consultant, effect on RTT clock depends on individual scenario
- If agreed 'thinking time' is short, RTT clock should continue to tick
- Example: Invasive surgery offered as proposed first definitive treatment, but patient wants few days to consider before confirming
- Providers encouraged to ensure discussion takes place where more than 14 days have passed without next steps being agreed

**Longer thinking time:**
- If longer period of 'thinking time' agreed, active monitoring¬π‚Å∑ more appropriate
- Example: Clinician offers surgical intervention, but patient not keen on invasive surgery at this stage as they view symptoms as manageable
- Review appointment agreed for three months' time and patient placed on active monitoring
- RTT clock would stop at point decision made to commence active monitoring
- New RTT clock would start when decision to treat made following period of active monitoring

**Active monitoring and diagnostic tests:**
- For patients on active monitoring, routine or regular diagnostic check-ups (e.g., six-monthly check cystoscopy) would NOT start new RTT clock
- However, if outcome of routine diagnostic check was that further treatment now required, this would start new RTT clock on date decision was made and communicated to patient

#### 4.4.2 Cancelled and Rearranged Appointments

> **General rule:** A cancelled or rearranged appointment, either patient-initiated or provider-initiated, will NOT in itself stop an RTT clock.

##### 4.4.2.1 Patient-Initiated Cancellations

**Effect on RTT clock:**
- If patient cancels, rearranges or postpones appointment, this has NO effect on RTT clock
- RTT clock should continue to tick
- **Exceptions:** Unless clinical decision is made to discharge patient back to care of their GP or start active monitoring

**Repeated cancellations:**
- Where patient repeatedly cancels appointments, clinicians should review appropriate next steps for their care
- May decide most appropriate action to avoid patient coming to harm is to discharge them back to care of their GP
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Patients should NOT be discharged back to their GP simply because they have cancelled or rearranged appointments
- Referral back to GP should always be clinical decision, based on individual patient's best clinical interest
- Please refer to section 8.3 for further detail

##### 4.4.2.2 Provider-Initiated Cancellations

**Effect on RTT clock:**
- If provider cancels appointment at any point in RTT pathway, this has NO effect on RTT waiting time
- RTT clock should continue to tick

**Treatment cancellation scenarios:**

| Scenario | RTT Clock Action |
|----------|------------------|
| **Cancelled after admission - resource constraints** | RTT clock continues to tick until patient ultimately starts treatment |
| **Cancelled after admission - clinical reasons** | RTT clock continues to tick unless clinical decision made that patient unsuitable and discharged to primary care or decision not to treat made |

> **Note:** Clinical cancellation scenario unlikely as issues should be picked up at pre-operative assessment stage or earlier on pathway.

## 5. Recording RTT Waiting Times: Planned Patients

### 5.1 RTT Measurement and Planned Patients

**Planned care definition:** An appointment/procedure or series of appointments/procedures as part of an agreed programme of care which is required for clinical reasons to be carried out at a specific time or repeated at a specific frequency.

> **Key principle:** Patients on planned waiting lists are **outside the scope of RTT measurement**.

**Appropriate use of planned lists:**
- ‚úÖ Patients should only be placed on planned list when due to have planned procedure/operation that is to take place at specific time
- ‚ùå Patients on RTT pathway should NOT be placed on planned list if they are unfit for procedure/operation
- **Alternative:** Instead, their clock should keep running unless clinical decision is made to discharge or start active monitoring

### 5.2 RTT Clock Start for Patients Transferring from a Planned List Requiring Admission

**Timing principle:** Patients on planned lists (requiring admission) should be booked at clinically appropriate time and should NOT have to wait further period after this time has elapsed.

**Example:** Patient due to have second stage operation in six months' time should be booked around six months later and should NOT get to six months then have to wait again for non-clinical reasons.

**Transfer to RTT pathway:**
- When patients on planned lists are clinically ready for treatment to commence and reach planned due date
- They should either:
  - ‚úÖ Receive treatment within appropriate clinical timescales
  - **OR**
  - ‚úÖ Be transferred to active waiting list and RTT waiting time clock should start (and be reported in RTT waiting time return)

**Diagnostic tests on planned lists:**
- When patients on planned lists for diagnostic tests (including surveillance procedures requiring admission) reach their planned due date
- They should either:
  - ‚úÖ Have their diagnostic test
  - **OR**
  - ‚úÖ DM01 clock (where appropriate) should commence
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Overdue planned diagnostics do NOT start an RTT clock

#### 5.2.1 Suggested Good Practice

**Service planning:**
- Commissioners and providers need to plan and manage services so that new and planned patients are treated at right time and in order of clinical priority
- Recognised that outpatient follow-up lists are managed differently to inpatient or daycase waiting lists

**Follow-up appointments post clock stop:**
- Patients requiring follow-up appointments post clock stop must be given clear expectation of timeframe for this, as required by best clinical evidence
- If this timeframe is exceeded and follow-up appointment becomes overdue, providers do NOT need to start RTT clock
- **However:** Should have good quality risk stratification to ensure those with greatest need are seen first
- Should have failsafe processes and recording and monitoring of Latest Clinically Appropriate Date (LCAD) to reduce harm for delayed outpatient appointments

**Operational oversight requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Providers must have operational oversight of ALL waiting lists irrespective of whether included within national waiting time returns
- ‚úÖ Providers should have systems to review any planned lists regularly to ensure planned appointments booked for right time
- ‚úÖ Ensure patient safety and standards of care are not compromised to detriment of outcomes for patients
- ‚úÖ Patients should be given written confirmation if placed on planned lists, including review date

**Benefits of effective communication:**
- Removes uncertainty for patients
- Ongoing review ensures patients' treatment is not delayed inappropriately

---

## 6. Recording RTT Waiting Times: Interface Services

### 6.1 Definition

> **Interface service definition:** Any arrangement that incorporates an intermediary level of clinical triage, assessment and treatment in or between traditional primary and secondary care.

**RTT measurement context:** RTT measurement relates to consultant-led care. Therefore, the definition of 'interface service' within RTT context does NOT apply to similar 'interface' arrangements established to deliver traditionally primary care or community provided services, outside of their traditional (practice or community based) setting.

#### Decision Framework for Interface Services

When making local decisions about whether a particular service meets the definition of an 'interface service', consider:

**‚ùå Does NOT meet interface service definition:**

| Question | If YES, then NOT interface service |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| **a) Traditional primary/community care** | Is the service one that has traditionally existed to deliver primary or community care? |
| **b) Same service, different setting** | Is the service one established to deliver traditionally provided community or primary care, just in different setting? |
| **c) Non consultant-led services relocated** | Is the service one established to bring solely non consultant-led services (e.g., direct access audiology services or therapies) outside of hospital setting? |

**‚úÖ DOES meet interface service definition if BOTH conditions met:**

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **a) Consultant referral substitute** | Service accepts referrals that would otherwise have traditionally been provided by consultant or consultant-led team |
| **b) Onward referral capability** | Referrals may go on to be onward referred to consultant-led service before responsibility transferred back to referring health professional or general practitioner |

> **If both conditions met:** Service should be classed as 'interface service', and consultant-led waiting time clock should start on receipt of referral.

#### Services Excluded from Interface Service Definition

The interface service definition does **NOT** apply to:

- ‚ùå Non consultant-led mental health services run by mental health trusts (mental health services that are not consultant-led)
- ‚ùå Referrals to 'practitioners with a special interest' for triage, assessment, and possible treatment
  - **Exception:** Where they are working as part of wider interface service type arrangements and have ability to refer on to consultant-led service

#### Referral Management or Assessment Services

**Definition:** Specific type of interface service that does not provide treatment but:
- Accepts GP (or other) referrals
- Provides advice on most appropriate next steps for place or treatment of patient
- Depending on nature of service, may or may not physically see or assess patient

**RTT clock requirement:** Referrals to referral management or assessment services should start consultant-led waiting times clock.

**Quality requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Should only be in place where they carry clinical support and abide by clear protocols that provide benefits to patients
- ‚ùå Must NOT be devices either to delay treatment or to avoid having clinical discussions with GP practices about good referral practice

---

## 7. Recording RTT Waiting Times: Community Health Services

### 7.1 Non Consultant-Led Community Services

> **RTT scope:** Referrals to community services, and subsequent contacts, that are **not consultant-led** are **not in scope of RTT**.

### 7.2 Consultant-Led Community Services

**RTT pathway status:** Where a community service is consultant-led, this is considered to be an RTT pathway and is subject to relevant RTT regulations.

**Reporting requirements:** To allow for consolidated reporting of community services activity, these pathways should be:
- ‚úÖ Recorded in relevant Community datasets
- ‚ùå Excluded from RTT data submissions

**Benefits of consolidated reporting:** Allows for consolidated reporting of consultant-led and non consultant-led community services data within one place for onward reporting and monitoring.

**Examples:** All community services such as Community Paediatrics and Community Medicine should be:
- ‚úÖ Recorded within community datasets
- ‚ùå Should NOT be reported within RTT data submissions

### 7.3 Consultant-Led Acute Activity Delivered Within a Community Setting

**Definition:** Service that is consultant-led service in community setting but is NOT classed as community service itself.

**Example:** Orthopaedic consultant providing outpatient services within community health centre.

**RTT requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Pathway remains in scope of RTT regulations and RTT data submissions
- ‚úÖ Includes interface services that are in scope of RTT under guidance in section 6
- ‚úÖ Consultant-led waiting time clock should start on receipt of referral
- ‚úÖ These pathways should be recorded within RTT data submissions

---

## 8. Patient-Initiated Delays and RTT Pathways

**Patient choice principle:** Many patients will choose to be seen at earliest opportunity. However, patients are entitled to wait longer if they wish. Patients must be allowed to plan their appointments around their personal circumstances.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Provider responsibility:** Providers must ensure that Local Access Policies and Standard Operating Procedures are in line with RTT Rules, protect the ability of patients to choose their time of treatment, and ensure that patients are not penalised through inappropriate actions.

### 8.1 Duration of Patient-Initiated Delays

**Blanket rules prohibition:** Providers must NOT have blanket rules that apply maximum length to patient-initiated delays that does not take account of individual patient circumstances.

**Patient protection mechanisms:** Providers should have mechanisms in place to protect patients who may come to harm by choosing to delay their treatment. This applies equally to those patients who may come to harm by repeatedly cancelling or failing to attend appointments.

#### Clinical Review Requirements

**For delays >6 weeks:** For any patient requesting to delay for more than 6 weeks, there should be clinical review to assess potential impact on patient's condition and treatment plan.

**Clinician not satisfied with delay:**
- If clinician is not satisfied that proposed delay is appropriate
- Clinical risks should be clearly communicated to patient
- Clinically appropriate date agreed

**Patient refuses clinical advice:**
- If patient refuses to accept advice of clinician
- Responsible clinician must act in best interest of patient
- If clinician feels it is in best clinical interest to discharge patient back to care of their GP and inform them that treatment is not progressing, this must be made clear to patient
- This must be clinical decision made in patient's best interest

13. See Annex D for more information on use of RTT Status Codes for clock stops resulting from administrative events.
14. The NHS Constitution (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england) sets out rights to which patients, public and staff are entitled, together with responsibilities, which public, patients and staff owe to one another to ensure NHS operates fairly and effectively.
15. Patients should be given 3 weeks' notice for appointments. Pragmatic application of guidance is encouraged, e.g. it is not reasonable to offer patient second date within same week that they are on holiday.
16. It is good practice for patients to be given full information about all alternative treatments, including non-operative and for them to make active decision to choose surgery. Please see https://www.england.nhs.uk/rightcare/ for more information.
17. Placing patient on active monitoring requires clinical decision and discussion with patient.

---

### 8.2 Patient Choice

**Legal right:** Patients have the legal right to choose the provider and consultant-led team for their first outpatient appointment.

**Early appointment offers:**
- Patients may be offered choice of earlier appointment with another consultant-led team
- If patient turns down this offer, their waiting time clock should continue to tick

#### Provider Changes

**Switching consultant-led teams:**
- Sometimes patient may wish to change to another consultant-led team for their treatment
- **If locally-agreed referral pathway allows** switch without being referred back to GP: waiting time clock continues to tick
- **If locally-agreed referral pathway requires** discharge back to GP for fresh referral: waiting time clock stops at discharge back to GP

#### Multiple Sites and Service Provision

**Mixed service provision:**
- Some providers/consultants provide services across multiple sites with mixed provision of outpatient, day case and inpatient facilities
- Patients may be offered choice of appointment/admission dates at alternative provider where clinically and socially appropriate

**Good practice for multiple sites:**
- Providers should ensure patient aware of site options when making choice
- Patient should be aware of any limitations on sites where their chosen consultant (or team member) can perform their procedure

**Clinical limitations:**
Choices may be limited by clinical appropriateness of services available at sites, including factors such as:
- ‚úÖ Requirement for general anaesthetic
- ‚úÖ Inpatient beds
- ‚úÖ Critical care
- ‚úÖ Specialist staffing
- ‚úÖ Specialist on-site equipment

### 8.3 Patients Wishing to Delay Their RTT Pathway

In circumstances where a patient wishes to delay their RTT pathway, the following approach may be considered:

#### Structured Approach to Patient Delays

| Step | Action | Timeframe |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **1. First decline** | Following declining first TCI or appointment date, second date should be offered | Within 6 weeks of first date |
| **2. Reasonable dates** | All dates offered should be reasonable | With 3 weeks' notice |
| **3. Second decline** | If second date declined, may be appropriate to consider placing patient on hospital-initiated active monitoring | Following clinical conversation and agreement with patient |
| **4. Extended delays** | Where patient wishes to delay pathway by more than six weeks | Clinical review should take place |
| **5. Active monitoring** | Where appropriate to place patient on active monitoring | Patients should be clinically reviewed every 12 weeks |

#### Pragmatic Application Guidelines

**Holiday considerations:**
- Pragmatic application of guidance encouraged
- Example: Not reasonable to offer patient second date within same week they are on holiday

**Declared unavailability:**
- Where patient declares period of unavailability (e.g., teacher wishes to wait until school holidays for treatment)
- May not be appropriate to offer specific dates (as known patient will not be able to attend)
- **Active monitoring consideration:** Should not be considered unless two reasonable dates could have been offered during period of declared unavailability

#### Active Monitoring Implementation

**Decision process:**
- If patient potentially to be placed on active monitoring, RTT clock should be stopped when there is decision agreed by both patient and clinician to start period of active monitoring

**Management requirements:**
- Patients placed on active monitoring should be managed through local reporting and local clinical governance arrangements
- Throughout agreed active monitoring period, patient should be advised of process to follow should they wish to continue pathway and be reinstated on waiting list

**Pathway continuation:**
- If patient wishes to continue pathway, provider should offer new date acting as if patient is on RTT waiting list at point they previously left
- ‚úÖ Patient should **NOT** be returned to beginning of waiting list
- üîÑ New clock should start on date patient decides to go ahead

---

## 9. Local Data Assurance and Governance

**Importance of accurate data:** Accurate recording and reporting of RTT data is central to:
- Meeting RTT operational waiting times standards
- Delivering maximum waiting times right to all eligible patients
- Informing patients' choices of where they want to be referred

**Shared responsibility:** All parts of NHS have role to play in ensuring waiting time data is recorded accurately.

**Primary responsibility:** Primary responsibility for accurate waiting time data starts with **chief executive of each organisation** who must take this responsibility seriously.

**Sign-off process:** Before submission to NHS England, all provider data should be:
- ‚úÖ Signed off by each provider
- ‚úÖ Reviewed by their relevant commissioners

#### NHS England Requirements

To ensure providers have robust data recording systems and processes in place, NHS England:

**Annual governance statements (from April 2015):**
- ‚úÖ Require all provider annual governance statements to include explicit statement on how provider will assure waiting time data quality, accuracy and risks

**Regular assurance (from April 2015):**
- ‚úÖ Mandated regular assurance of waiting times data within respective accountability frameworks for organisations through internal audit, external audit, or quality reports

### 9.1 RTT Data Quality Assurance Checklist

> **Purpose:** The following checklist is useful guide for all NHS organisations providing consultant-led services to assure quality of RTT data they submit. Organisations that cannot answer **yes** to each question will need to address issues raised.

#### ‚úÖ Checklist Questions

**1. Have referral dates and other RTT clock starts been recorded for all your patients?**

*Why this matters:*
- Without knowing clock starts for all patients, NHS organisations will not know where each patient is on their RTT pathway
- Good waiting list management requires treating patients according to clinical priority and then in order they were added to list
- Requires properly recorded clock starts

*Includes:*
- Referrals through Electronic Referral Service (eRS)
- Referral Assessment Service (RAS) where they have not yet been booked but may appear on Appointment Slot Issue worklists or equivalent

**2. Do you know the original referral dates/clock starts for all patients transferred to you from other hospitals or interface services?**

*Why this matters:*
- Waiting times standards apply equally to patients who transfer between hospitals and from interface services
- Mandatory for all organisations to transfer Inter Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS) for patients as they move between organisations
- Ensures key information (e.g., clock starts) transfers with them

**3. Do your systems capture the end of all RTT pathways?**

*RTT clock stops when:*
- ‚úÖ Patient starts consultant-led treatment
- ‚úÖ Patient starts therapy or healthcare science intervention as decided by consultant
- ‚úÖ Patient is added to national transplant waiting list¬π‚Å∏
- ‚úÖ Patient is returned to primary care for non consultant-led treatment
- ‚úÖ Decision is made to start period of active monitoring by consultant and patient
- ‚úÖ Patient declines treatment
- ‚úÖ Clinical decision is made not to treat
- ‚úÖ Patient is discharged by their clinician back into care of their GP

*System requirements:*
- Organisations must have mechanisms in place to capture and report end of all pathways
- Most providers have implemented systems which record clinical outcomes in outpatient clinics and capture clinical decisions made outside of clinics

**4. Do you know how many clock starts are due to planned patients not being seen in time?**

*Reference:*
- Section 5 outlines circumstances when new waiting time clock should start when planned admission for treatment does not start within appropriate clinical timescales
- Ideally no new clock would start, as patient should not wait beyond clinically appropriate date

**5. Are any emergency admissions mistakenly being included in the RTT return?**

*Rule:*
- Patients whose pathway commences as emergency presentation (typically but not exclusively through A&E or minor injuries department) should NOT be included within RTT reports
- **Exception:** Unless and until decision to refer for further elective diagnostic tests or treatment is made

**6. Do you review waits over 18 weeks?**

*Why important:*
- Will inform you why these occurred
- Enable you to take action to avoid unnecessary long waits for your patients in future

**7. Is your total list size increasing? Or are your clearance times increasing?**

*Early warning signs:*
- Increasing list size or clearance time may be early warning sign for commissioner and its provider
- Indicates number of patients being referred is out of balance with capacity being provided
- Suggests waiting times are at risk of increasing

*Clearance times definition:*
- Provide means for assessing relative size of waiting list
- Calculated by comparing number of patients waiting with typical week's RTT activity
- Expressed as number of weeks it would notionally take to treat stock of incomplete pathways if no new clocks were started, and clocks continue to be stopped at current rate

*Support available:*
- NHS England Operational Insights team can provide advice on calculating clearance times
- Contact: england.rtt@nhs.net

## 10. Reporting Referral to Treatment Statistics to NHS England

> **Target audience:** This section is intended for staff involved in preparation and submission of monthly aggregate RTT data.

**Data collection method:** Data collected via Strategic Data Collection Service (SDCS)
**Data owner:** NHS England

### 10.1 Submitting Data

**Performance monitoring:** Performance against operational standard for consultant-led (RTT) waiting times is monitored against aggregate monthly data:
- ‚úÖ Submitted via SDCS online data collections tool
- ‚úÖ Published on NHS England website: http://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/

**Additional reporting requirements:** Organisations also mandated to submit RTT data via:
- ‚úÖ Secondary Uses Service (SUS)
- ‚úÖ Weekly Waiting List Minimum Dataset (WLMDS)

#### SUS RTT Reporting Application

**Basis:** Based upon use of national standard Commissioning Data Sets (CDS) submitted through SUS

**Process:**
- CDS records reflect individual patient interactions (e.g., individual appointments or consultant episodes)
- SUS constructs RTT pathways information by linking CDS records for individual patients
- Identifies types of events represented by each record
- Groups events into RTT pathways and calculates duration of pathway

**Technical details:** Because information recorded in Patient Administration Systems is used for both SDCS and SUS reporting, this guidance includes technical details relating to use of CDS records (separated as annexes)

**Additional guidance:** Advice on submission of CDS data via SUS: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dapb0092-commissioning-data-sets

**WLMDS information:** https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/wlmds/

#### 10.1.1 Monthly Data Requirement to Report RTT Statistics via SDCS

##### 10.1.1.1 Who Should Report Data?

**Scope:** Any organisation that provides NHS services that fall within scope of RTT should complete provider return to SDCS portal and submit via WLMDS.

**Applicable organisations:**
- ‚úÖ Acute trusts
- ‚úÖ Specialist trusts
- ‚úÖ Mental health trusts
- ‚úÖ Any other provider of consultant-led services for NHS patients in England including Independent Sector providers
- ‚úÖ Providers of interface services as defined in section 6

**Data collection assurance:** RTT data collection has DCB (Data Coordination Board) assurance, while NHS Standard Contract requires providers to report monthly RTT data.

**Collection basis:** Data collection is provider and commissioner based.

**Independent Sector providers:** Where NHS care is funded and directly commissioned by SUB-ICB or NHS England, Independent Sector (IS) providers should:
- ‚úÖ Engage in RTT data collection process by monitoring RTT times for NHS patients being seen/treated at their sites
- ‚úÖ Submit this information to SDCS in same way as NHS provider organisations
- See section 10.1.2 for guidance on requesting SDCS account

**Commissioner requirements:** Commissioners required to check data for their commissioned patients made available through SEFT (Secure Electronic File Transfer).

**ODS codes:** Normally expect providers submitting RTT data to do so using NHS Trust, Independent Sector Healthcare Provider, Independent Sector Healthcare Provider Site or NHS Care Trust ODS (Organisation Data Service) code¬π‚Åπ.

**Missing ODS codes:** Organisations that provide NHS services within scope of RTT but do not have appropriate ODS code can:
- Request code using form on ODS website: Request a new code or update organisation details - NHS England Digital
- Contact England.RTT@nhs.net for further advice

##### 10.1.1.2 Format of the Data Collection

**Structure:** National data collection looks at RTT waiting times in weeks, split by treatment function. Returns submitted by providers, split by commissioner.

**RTT data collection template sections:**

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Part 1a - Completed pathways ‚Äì admitted** | RTT waited times for cases where patients completed their RTT pathway during the month with an inpatient or day case admission |
| **Part 1b - Completed pathways ‚Äì non-admitted** | RTT waited times for cases where patients completed their RTT pathway during the month for reasons other than an inpatient or day case admission |
| **Part 2 - Incomplete pathways** | RTT waiting times so far for cases where patients are still waiting to start treatment at the end of the reporting month. This is a 'snapshot' on the last day of the reporting period |
| **Part 2a ‚Äì Incomplete pathways with a decision to admit for treatment** | RTT waiting times so far for cases where patients are still waiting to start treatment at the end of the reporting month where a clinical decision to admit to a hospital bed for treatment has been made |
| **Part 3 ‚Äì New RTT periods** | Number of new RTT periods during the month |

**Historical changes:** Submission of adjusted monthly RTT data, in addition to unadjusted data, was required for March 2008 to September 2015. From October 2015 data (submitted in November 2015):
- ‚ùå Adjusted RTT data collection return no longer required
- ‚ûï Two new data items added

**Changes from October 2015 onwards:**
- ‚ùå No longer requirement to submit admitted adjusted data to NHS England
- ‚úÖ Unadjusted admitted and non-admitted completed pathway data still required but will no longer be used for monitoring against operational standards
- ‚úÖ Requirement to report incomplete pathway data remains unchanged (always been unadjusted submission)
- ‚ûï Two new data items added: incomplete pathways for patients with decision to admit and new RTT periods

##### 10.1.1.3 Changes to Existing Data Collection Template ‚Äì From April 2021

**Changes made from April 2021 data onwards:**

**1. Commissioning codes:**
- Phased out use of X24 code entirely
- Moved to more granular NHS England commissioning codes

**2. Time bands:**
- Additional weekly time bands from 52-53 weeks to 104+ added to Parts 1A, 1B, 2 and 2A of collection

**3. Treatment function categories changes:**

**a) 21/22 changes as notified by NHS Digital:**

*i. Treatment function name updates*

*ii. Reporting 'exceptions' guidance updates* - Two new exceptions added:
- **Orthopaedic Service (111) and Trauma Surgery Service (115)** should be included in Trauma and Orthopaedics (110) *(Note: In addition to existing reporting exception that Spinal Surgery Service (108) should be included in Trauma and Orthopaedics (110))*
- **Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (145) and Maxillofacial Surgery (144)** should be included in Oral Surgery (140)

**b) 'Other' category separation into five groups:**
- Other ‚Äì Surgical Services
- Other ‚Äì Paediatric Services
- Other ‚Äì Medical Services
- Other ‚Äì Mental Health Services
- Other ‚Äì Other Services

#### 10.1.2 How to Submit and Review Data

##### Provider Submission via SDCS

**Process:**
1. Data collected online via SDCS portal
2. Providers download spreadsheet-based form
3. Enter data broken down by commissioner
4. Functionality in form semi-automates this and allows CSV import of data
5. Providers upload completed spreadsheet to SDCS portal

**Applicable providers:**
- Acute trusts, specialist trusts, mental health trusts
- Any other provider of consultant-led services for NHS patients in England, including independent sector providers

##### Commissioner Review via SEFT

**Process:**
1. Once providers begin to submit, daily commissioner-based files automatically produced from providers' data
2. Made available to Sub-ICBs through SEFT website
3. Following provider deadline, commissioners have **five days** to download and review their data
4. Check for errors, inconsistencies and missing data
5. If issues identified, commissioner should raise these with relevant providers
6. Where data provider resubmits figures, included in next daily commissioner file available in SEFT
7. All changes must be completed prior to commissioner review deadline

**Detailed guidance:** https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/guidance-prov-comms/

**SEFT access:** Sub-ICBs requiring access to SEFT should contact england.rtt@nhs.net

#### 10.1.3 Timetable for Data Submission

**Timetable availability:** https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/collections-timetable/

**Key deadlines:**
- **Provider deadline:** 13 working days after final day of reference period
- **Commissioner assurance deadline:** 18 working days after end of reference period

#### 10.1.4 Reporting RTT Data by Treatment Function

**Treatment functions for data submission:**

| Code | Service |
|------|---------|
| 100 | General Surgery Service |
| 101 | Urology Service |
| 110 | Trauma & Orthopaedics Service |
| 120 | Ear, Nose & Throat Service |
| 130 | Ophthalmology Service |
| 140 | Oral Surgery Service |
| 150 | Neurosurgery Service |
| 160 | Plastic Surgery Service |
| 170 | Cardiothoracic Surgery Service |
| 300 | General Internal Medicine Service |
| 301 | Gastroenterology Service |
| 320 | Cardiology Service |
| 330 | Dermatology Service |
| 340 | Respiratory Medicine Service |
| 400 | Neurology Service |
| 410 | Rheumatology Service |
| 430 | Elderly Medicine Service |
| 502 | Gynaecology Service |

**'Other' categories:**
- X02: Other ‚Äì Medical Services (All other treatment functions in Medical Services group not reported individually)
- X03: Other ‚Äì Mental Health Services (All other treatment functions in Mental Health group not reported individually)
- X04: Other ‚Äì Paediatric Services (All other treatment functions in Paediatric group not reported individually)
- X05: Other ‚Äì Surgical Services (All other treatment functions in Surgical group not reported individually)
- X06: Other ‚Äì Other Services (All other treatment functions in Other group not reported individually)

**Treatment Function Code definitions:** https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0028-treatment-function-and-main-specialty-standard

**Selection rationale:** 18 treatment functions listed separately were chosen as high volume areas with large volume of RTT pathways.

**Form amendment:** From April 2021, 'Other' category split into five subgroups for better granularity.

**Aggregation rule:** Data for any other treatment functions not separately reported should be aggregated and reported on appropriate 'other' treatment function subcategories, depending on which treatment function group they fall under.

**Reference for grouping:** NHS Digital's Treatment Function and Main Specialty Standard Code List Specification provides details of treatment function group for all treatment function codes.

**Example:** General Medicine (300) should include data relating to 300 and exclude sub-specialties 306, 307, 308 and 309. These sub-specialties are all within Medical Services group and should therefore be included in 'Other ‚Äì Medical Services' line.

**Exceptions to rule:**
- **Cardiothoracic Surgery:** Can be either specialty 170 (Cardiothoracic) or aggregation of 172 (Cardiac) and 173 (Thoracic)
- **Spinal Surgery Service (108), Orthopaedic Service (111) and Trauma Surgery Service (115)** should be included in Trauma and Orthopaedics (110)
- **Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (145) and Maxillofacial Surgery (144)** should be included in Oral Surgery (140)

**Pathway reporting rules:**
- **Completed pathway:** Should be reported against treatment function of activity that stopped RTT clock
- **Incomplete pathway:** Treatment function can change while RTT pathway progresses; data should be submitted against treatment functions based on classification at time of submission

#### 10.1.5 Unknown Clock Starts

**Provider responsibility:** Providers responsible for proper validation of any patient who may have incomplete RTT pathway.

**Importance:** Important that clock starts can be accurately identified for all patients on RTT pathway.

**Unknown clock start reporting:** In unlikely event that provider cannot accurately identify RTT clock start date, patients can be reported on RTT return in 'unknown clock start' column.

**IPTAMDS importance:** Important that receiving providers ensure that initiating providers supply adequate information when transferring patients via Inter Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS, see section 11).

**Historical pathway validation:** If validation establishes that some RTT pathways have already been completed prior to current reporting period (clock stopped in previous month), these should NOT be added to monthly reporting of completed RTT pathways for current reporting period.

#### 10.1.6 Revisions Process

**Before submission deadline:**
- If error discovered before submission deadline, providers can simply upload amended version of their return to SDCS
- Uploading amended return will automatically overwrite previous return

**After provider deadline:**
- If error discovered after provider deadline, email england.rtt@nhs.net with brief description of error
- If on or shortly after submission deadline, likely you can be granted extension to correct data
- If significantly after submission deadline, contact england.rtt@nhs.net to discuss options

**Published data revisions:**
- NHS England will consider all requests for revisions to published RTT data in line with NHS England Analytical Services revisions policy: http://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/code-compliance/#Unifypolicy
- Data revisions normally published every six months (generally in January and July), alongside latest release of new monthly data

#### 10.1.7 Measuring the Length of RTT Pathways

##### Assigning RTT Pathways to Weekly Time Bands

**Time band structure:** Data should be allocated to time bands: 0-1 weeks, >1-2 weeks, >2-3 weeks, then for all weekly time bands through to >103-104 weeks, >104 weeks.

**Time band allocation examples:**
- **0 to 1 weeks:** Includes patients waiting/having waited 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days
- **1 to 2 weeks:** Includes patients waiting/having waited 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 days
- **17 to 18 weeks:** Includes patients waiting/having waited 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125 and 126 days
- **51 to 52 weeks:** Includes patients waiting/having waited 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363 and 364 days
- **104+ weeks:** Includes patients waiting/having waited 729 days and more

> **Note:** Eight reporting days in 0-1 week time band as it includes waits of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days.

**18-week threshold:** Patient who has waited exactly 18 weeks (126 days) is included in 17-18 weeks time band.

##### Very Short RTT Pathways

**Inclusion principle:** All valid RTT pathways should be included in monitoring returns, regardless of their length.

**Zero-day pathways:**
- RTT clock that started and stopped on same day will have RTT time of zero days
- Should still be recorded as completed pathways in RTT data collection
- Should be reported in 0-1 week time band on collection template

**Example:** Patient who presents at consultant-led drop-in clinic and subsequently starts first definitive treatment on that day.

**Emergency pathway exclusion:** Patients whose pathway commences as emergency presentation (typically but not exclusively through A&E or minor injuries department) should NOT be included within RTT reports, unless and until decision to refer for further elective diagnostic tests or treatment is made.

#### 10.1.8 Assigning Commissioner Codes

**Basic rules for assigning commissioner code to RTT pathways:**

| Scenario | Commissioner Code |
|----------|------------------|
| **NHS England commissioning** | Use relevant commissioner code as outlined in NHS England Commissioning Responsibilities Matrix |
| **Non-English commissioners** | Use code NONC for non-English commissioners in aggregate monthly RTT data return *(Note: specific relevant commissioner code should be used for non-English commissioners in record-level WLMDS collection)* |
| **Everything else** | Use SUB-ICB code in following order:<br>‚Ä¢ SUB-ICB of GP practice if known<br>‚Ä¢ Then SUB-ICB of residence if no GP<br>‚Ä¢ Then 'host' SUB-ICB if no GP or resident postcode |

**Reference:** See latest Commissioner Assignment Method ‚Äì Supporting Tables Spreadsheet at https://www.england.nhs.uk/data-services/commissioning-flows/

**Specialist activity:** NHS England aware of issues around identifying specialist activity, especially for incomplete RTT pathways. Providers should assign pathways/activity as specialised to best of their knowledge at time of submission, same principle that applies to applying pathways/activity to treatment functions.

#### 10.1.9 Reporting Data for Patients Who Move Between the Countries of the UK

##### 10.1.9.1 Patients Who Transfer to an English Commissioner

**Transfer scenario:** For patients whose pathway has already started outside of England but subsequently become responsibility of English commissioner (e.g., patient moves from Scotland to England):

**Clock start rule:** RTT clock will start on date that new provider receives referral, after clinical responsibility for patient's care has transferred to English NHS commissioner.

**No backdating:** Whilst patient's RTT clock cannot be back dated to start from time they were originally referred for treatment by non-English commissioner, English commissioners should:
- Take account of how long patients have already waited
- Look to treat them without undue delay and according to their clinical need

##### 10.1.9.2 Patients Treated in England Whose Commissioner is in Wales or Scotland

**Reporting principle:** RTT data for non-contract activity should be recorded against commissioning organisation (in line with PbR)¬≤‚Å∞.

**Commissioner code assignment:** RTT pathways commissioned by non-English commissioners should be assigned to commissioner code NONC in aggregate monthly RTT data return *(Note: specific relevant commissioner code should be used for non-English commissioners in record-level WLMDS collection)*.

#### 10.1.10 NHS England Commissioned Activity and RTT Reporting

**Commission distribution:** Most services provided in NHS are commissioned by Sub-ICBs. However, some services are commissioned by NHS England.

**NHS England commissioning scope:**
- Specialised services
- Offender healthcare
- Some services for members of armed forces

**Specialised services definition:** Services provided in relatively few hospitals, accessed by comparatively small numbers of patients. These services tend to be located in specialised hospitals that can recruit team of staff with appropriate expertise and enable them to develop their skills.

**Guidance reference:** For guidance on identifying specialised services activity see specialised commissioning 'Manual' and 'Identification Rules' published here: http://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/spec-services/key-docs/

**RTT application:** RTT measurement applies to consultant-led services commissioned by NHS England in same way as it applies to Sub ICB-commissioned services.

**Reporting requirement:** Patients on RTT pathway who are waiting for services commissioned by NHS England should be reported as part of RTT data collection.

**Commissioner code assignment:** RTT pathways commissioned by NHS England should be submitted against relevant commissioning code in SDCS returns¬≤¬π.

**Specific groups included:**

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **MoD patients** | Patients registered with English MoD Defence Medical Services (DMS) practice¬≤¬≤ and whose healthcare activity will be paid for via NHS England commissioner |
| **Prison-based patients** | Can be identified on basis of their usual place of residence being permanent detention centre |
| **Specialised health services** | Commissioned by NHS England |
| **Dental services (April 2013 to March 2023)** | NHS England had commissioning responsibility for all NHS dental services: primary, community and secondary, including dental out of hours and urgent care¬≤¬≥ |

> **Note:** From April 2023, responsibility for secondary dental provision was transferred from NHS England to Integrated Care Boards (ICBs).

### 10.2 Data Quality

#### 10.2.1 Responsibility for Data Quality

**Accuracy requirement:** Organisations should provide as accurate data as possible by submission deadline.

**Provider responsibilities:** As with all central returns, provider organisations responsible for ensuring that:
- Completed pathways they submit are accurate representation of waited times of RTT patients treated during month
- Incomplete pathways are accurate representation of RTT patients still waiting to start treatment at end of month at their organisation

**Commissioner responsibilities:** Commissioner organisations responsible for ensuring that data submitted against them is accurate representation of waiting times for patients they have commissioned services for.

**Commissioner review process:** If commissioners have concerns about data, they should use five working days between provider deadline and commissioner assurance deadline to query data with their providers. See section 8 for more information on local data assurance.

**Central validation:** NHS England also runs monthly central validation checks on submitted RTT data (see Annex B for details of checks).

**Data quality issue reporting:** When providers aware of data quality issues, they should inform Operational Insights team (england.rtt@nhs.net) as part of validation process. This ensures:
- Where possible, issues are resolved and data quality improved prior to publication
- Where issues require longer-term solution, data can be improved as part of six-monthly revisions process

### 10.3 Non-Reporting of Data by Providers

**Mandatory guidelines:** NHS England published mandatory guidelines setting out responsibilities of providers of NHS services who want to request suspension of reporting of mandatory data, including RTT returns: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/guidance-non-submissions/

**Provider requirements:** All providers should ensure that:
- ‚úÖ Appropriate actions are taken to meet all reporting requirements
- ‚úÖ Have robust governance arrangements and contingency plans in place to support continuing provision of monthly RTT data returns

**Exceptional circumstances:** In exceptional circumstances, where provider has no confidence in accuracy of its RTT data, it may be appropriate to suspend reporting.

**Decision ownership:** Decision to suspend submission of data needs to be decision taken and owned by board of provider.

**Board oversight:** Expectation is that plan to resolve problem and oversight of associated mitigating actions will be key issue for Board to monitor closely until issues are completely resolved.

**Serious decision:** Decision by provider not to submit data returns is serious one and should not be taken lightly as likely impact on organisation can be significant. NHS trust will be highlighted in any national publications as not being able to submit data.

## 11. Reporting Waiting Times for Patients Who Transfer Between Organisations

### 11.1 Reporting RTT Waiting Times for Transferred Patients

**Reporting principle:** RTT waits should be reported by the Provider that has **overall clinical responsibility** for the patient.

#### Multi-Provider Pathways

**Clinical responsibility baton:** For multi-provider pathways (e.g., pathways that involve transfer to tertiary centre), the RTT measurement and reporting baton passes with the clinical responsibility baton.

**Transfer process:**
- **If provider A refers to provider B and clinical responsibility is transferring:**
  - Provider B should start to monitor and report patient's RTT time on their RTT return (and PTL where relevant)
  - ‚ùå No longer any central requirement for provider A to track patient's RTT time¬≤‚Å¥
  - ‚úÖ However, they may want to make local arrangement that provider B keeps them informed of patient's progress

**Diagnostic/opinion referrals:**
- **If provider A refers patient to provider B simply for diagnostic or opinion and provider A is retaining overall clinical responsibility:**
  - Provider A retains measurement baton
  - Should continue to report patient on their RTT return and PTL

### 11.2 Subcontracting Relationships and RTT Reporting¬≤‚Åµ

**Core principle:** Principle of RTT waits being reported by provider that has overall clinical responsibility for patient also applies to any patients treated in another provider under subcontract.

#### Long-Waiting Patient Agreements

**Discussion requirement:** Where providers agree to accept referrals from another provider for patients who will wait or already have waited longer than 18 weeks, discussion should take place between providers to agree who will report these long-waiting patients.

#### Exceptional Circumstances

**Alternative provider requests:** In exceptional circumstances, where alternative provider requests that original provider continues to report patient's RTT wait because of impact on their performance, assurance must be obtained that:

**a) Commissioner agreement:** Agreed explicitly and in advance by patient's commissioning organisation ‚Äì not least to ensure alternative provider treating patient has Clinical Negligence Scheme for Providers (CNST) cover under CNST indemnity

**b) Clinical appropriateness:** Supported by evidence that demonstrates that it is clinically appropriate and safe for patient concerned

**Notification requirement:** Operational Insights team (england.rtt@nhs.net) should be advised of any such arrangements.

**Commissioner performance:** This approach has no effect on commissioner reported RTT performance. Each commissioner must continue to ensure that RTT performance is reported for all its patients regardless of which provider treats them.

**Contractual clarity:** Terms of any subcontract should set out which provider is responsible for reporting RTT waits of patients.

### 11.3 Inter-Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS)

**Importance:** Important that correct start date is captured for patients who transfer from interface services to secondary care providers and from provider to provider.

**Purpose:** IPTAMDS aids providers receiving patients mid-way along their RTT pathway, including tertiary centres. Purpose is to ensure that administrative RTT data required to enable receiving provider to report on patient pathway is transferred from referring provider to receiving provider when responsibility for patient's care has transferred.

**Key requirement:** Referring provider must ensure that patient's initial RTT clock start date forms part of onward referral information to ensure that:
- ‚úÖ Patients' waiting times are correctly recorded
- ‚úÖ They are treated within maximum waiting times

#### Mandatory Use

**IPTAMDS is mandatory for:**
- ‚úÖ Transfers between interface services and secondary care providers
- ‚úÖ Transfers between secondary and tertiary providers

**Specific scenarios requiring IPTAMDS completion:**

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **i. Provider transfer** | Care of patient on RTT pathway transfers between healthcare providers. This includes transfers to and from Independent Sector providers where this transfer is part of NHS commissioned care |
| **ii. Clinical opinion transfer** | Request for clinical opinion results in patient's care being transferred to alternative provider |
| **iii. English NHS commissioning** | RTT pathways are commissioned by English NHS commissioners independent of location |

#### Examples

**Example 1: Interface service transfer**
- Patient's original referral from GP received by interface service on **2 January**
- After carrying out initial assessment, interface service decided to refer patient on to acute provider for treatment
- Acute provider receives referral on **28 January**
- **‚úÖ Acute provider should record RTT start date for this patient as 2 January, NOT 28 January**

**Example 2: Provider-to-provider transfer**
- Patient's original referral from GP received by provider A on **2 January**
- After carrying out initial assessment, provider A decided to refer patient on to tertiary provider (provider B) for treatment
- Provider B receives referral on **28 January**
- **‚úÖ Provider B should record RTT start date for this patient as 2 January, NOT 28 January**

**Content:** Published data set includes data for all providers and all commissioners.

**Access:** http://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/

---

## 13. Terminology and Definitions

### A

**Active monitoring**
- A waiting time clock may be stopped where it is clinically appropriate to start a period of monitoring in secondary care without clinical intervention or diagnostic procedures at that stage
- A new waiting time clock would start when a decision to treat is made following a period of active monitoring (also known as watchful waiting)
- An RTT waiting time clock may be stopped where it is clinically appropriate to start a period of active monitoring when a patient wishes to delay their pathway

**Admission**
- The act of admitting a patient for a day case or inpatient procedure

**Admitted pathway**
- A pathway that ends in a clock stop for admission (day case or inpatient)

**Appointment Slot Issue (ASI)**
- When no clinic appointment is available for patients to book in the NHS e-Referral Service, the referral can be forwarded or deferred to the patient's chosen provider to enable the provider to book the patient an appointment
- When a referral is forwarded or deferred, it will appear on that provider's appointment slot issues (ASI) worklist

### B

**Bilateral (procedure)**
- A procedure that is performed on both sides of the body, at matching anatomical sites
- For example, removal of cataracts from both eyes

### C

**Care Professional**
- A person who is a member of a profession regulated by a body mentioned in section 25(3) of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002

**Clinical decision**
- A decision taken by a clinician or other qualified care professional, in consultation with the patient, and with reference to local access policies and commissioning arrangements

**Consultant**
- A person contracted by a healthcare provider who has been appointed by a consultant appointment committee
- They must be a member of a Royal College or Faculty
- Consultant-led waiting times exclude non-medical scientists of equivalent standing (to a consultant) within diagnostic departments

**Consultant-led**
- A consultant retains overall clinical responsibility for the service, team or treatment
- The consultant will not necessarily be physically present for each patient's appointment, but they take overall clinical responsibility for patient care

**Convert(s) their UBRN**
- When an appointment has been booked via the NHS e-Referral Service, the UBRN is converted
- (Please see definition of UBRN)

### D

**DNA ‚Äì Did Not Attend**
- When a patient misses their appointment, it is referred to as a 'Did Not Attend' (DNA) or Was Not Brought (WNB)
- In the context of consultant-led waiting times, this is defined as where a patient fails to attend an appointment/admission without prior notice

**Direct access referral**
- Describes a situation where a GP, or other referrer, makes a referral for a diagnostic test with the intention that the responsibility for the patient remains with the GP and there is no intention for the patient to go on to see a consultant or consultant-led service at that stage

**Decision to admit**
- Where a clinical decision is taken to admit the patient for either day case or inpatient treatment

**Decision to treat**
- Where a clinical decision is taken to treat the patient
- This could be treatment as an inpatient or day case, but also includes treatments performed in other settings, for example, as an outpatient

### F

**First definitive treatment**
- An intervention intended to manage a patient's disease, condition or injury and avoid further intervention
- What constitutes first definitive treatment is a matter for clinical judgement, in consultation with others as appropriate, including the patient

**Fit and ready (in the context of bilateral procedures)**
- A new RTT clock should start once the patient is fit and ready for a subsequent bilateral procedure
- In this context, fit and ready means that the clock should start from the date that it is clinically appropriate for the patient to undergo that procedure, and from when the patient says they are available

### H

**Healthcare science intervention**
- See Therapy or Healthcare science intervention

### I

**Interface service (non consultant-led interface service)**
- All arrangements that incorporate any intermediary levels of clinical triage, assessment and treatment between traditional primary and secondary care
- Consultant-led referral to treatment relates to hospital/consultant-led care. Therefore, the definition of the term 'interface service' for the purpose of consultant-led waiting times does not apply to similar 'interface' arrangements established to deliver traditionally primary care or community provided services, outside of their traditional (practice or community based) setting

**The definition does not apply to:**
- Non consultant-led mental health services run by mental health trusts
- Referrals to 'practitioners with a special interest' for triage, assessment and possible treatment, except where they are working as part of a wider interface service type arrangements as described above

### N

**NHS e-Referral Service (formerly Choose and Book)**
- A national electronic referral service that gives patients a choice of place, date and time for their first consultant outpatient appointment in a hospital or clinic

**Non-admitted pathway**
- A pathway that results in a clock stop for treatment that does not require an admission or for 'non-treatment'

**Non consultant-led**
- Where a consultant does not take overall clinical responsibility for the patient

**Non consultant-led interface service**
- See interface service

### P

**Patient pathway**
- A patient pathway is usually considered to be their journey from first contact with the NHS for an individual condition, through referral, diagnosis and treatment for that condition
- For chronic or recurrent conditions, a patient pathway will continue beyond the point at which first definitive treatment starts, as it will include further treatment for the same condition
- A person may therefore have multiple RTT periods (see Referral to treatment period) along one patient pathway
- NHS England often uses the term 'RTT pathway' in published reports and in this document and this is the same as an 'RTT period'

**Planned care**
- An appointment/procedure or series of appointments/procedures as part of an agreed programme of care which is required for clinical reasons to be carried out at a specific time or repeated at a specific frequency

### R

**Reasonable offer**
- An offer is reasonable where the offer for an outpatient appointment or an offer of admission is for a time and date three or more weeks from the time that the offer was made
- Pragmatic application of the guidance is encouraged, e.g. it is not reasonable to offer a patient a second date within the same week that they are on holiday

**Referral Management or assessment service**
- Referral management or assessment services are those that do not provide treatment, but accept GP (or other) referrals and provide advice on the most appropriate next steps for the place or treatment of the patient
- Depending on the nature of the service they may, or may not, physically see or assess the patient
- Should only be in place where they carry clinical support and abide by clear protocols that provide benefits to patients
- They must not be devices either to delay treatment or to avoid local clinical discussions about good referral practice
- A waiting time clock only starts on referral to a referral management and assessment service where that service may onward-refer the patient to a surgical or medical consultant-led service before responsibility is transferred back to the referring health professional

**Referral to treatment period**
- An RTT period is the time between a person's referral to a consultant-led service, which initiates a clock start, and the point at which the clock stops for any of the reasons set out in the RTT national clock rules, for example the start of first definitive treatment or a decision that treatment is not appropriate

### S

**Straight to test**
- For certain pathways clinicians are able to refer patients directly for a diagnostic test, bypassing the traditional initial hospital outpatient appointment

**Substantively new or different treatment**
- Upon completion of a consultant-led referral to treatment period, a new waiting time clock starts upon the decision to start a substantively new or different treatment that does not already form part of that patient's agreed care plan
- It is recognised that a patient's care often extends beyond the consultant-led referral to treatment period, and that there may be a number of planned treatments beyond first definitive treatment
- However, where further treatment is required that did not form part of the patient's original treatment plan, a new waiting time clock should start at the point the decision to treat is made

**Scenarios where this might apply:**
- Where less 'invasive/intensive' forms of treatment have been unsuccessful and more 'aggressive/intensive' treatment is required (for example, where Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI) has been unsuccessful and a decision is made to refer for IVF treatment)
- Patients attending regular follow up outpatient appointments, where a decision is made to try a substantively new or different treatment. In this context, a change to the dosage of existing medication may not count as substantively new or different treatment, whereas a change to medication combined with a decision to refer the patient for therapy might

**Decision-making:** Ultimately, the decision about whether the treatment is substantively new or different from the patient's agreed care plan is one that must be made locally by a care professional in consultation with the patient.

### T

**TCI**
- To come in date or the date offered for admission to hospital

**Therapy or Healthcare science intervention**
- Where a consultant-led or interface service decides that therapy (for example physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, podiatry, counselling) or healthcare science (for example, hearing aid fitting) is the best way to manage the patient's disease, condition or injury and avoid further interventions

### U

**UBRN (Unique Booking Reference Number)**
- The reference number that a patient receives on their appointment request letter when generated by the referrer through the NHS e-Referral Service
- The UBRN is used in conjunction with the patient password to make or change an appointment

### W

**Was Not Brought (WNB)**
- When a patient misses their appointment, it is referred to as a 'Did Not Attend' (DNA) or Was Not Brought (WNB)
- In the context of consultant-led waiting times, this is defined as where a patient fails to attend an appointment/admission without prior notice

### A

**Active monitoring**
- A waiting time clock may be stopped where it is clinically appropriate to start a period of monitoring in secondary care without clinical intervention or diagnostic procedures at that stage
- A new waiting time clock would start when a decision to treat is made following a period of active monitoring (also known as watchful waiting)
- An RTT waiting time clock may be stopped where it is clinically appropriate to start a period of active monitoring when a patient wishes to delay their pathway

**Admission**
- The act of admitting a patient for a day case or inpatient procedure

**Admitted pathway**
- A pathway that ends in a clock stop for admission (day case or inpatient)

**Appointment Slot Issue (ASI)**
- When no clinic appointment is available for patients to book in the NHS e-Referral Service, the referral can be forwarded or deferred to the patient's chosen provider to enable the provider to book the patient an appointment
- When a referral is forwarded or deferred, it will appear on that provider's appointment slot issues (ASI) worklist

### B

**Bilateral (procedure)**
- A procedure that is performed on both sides of the body, at matching anatomical sites
- For example, removal of cataracts from both eyes

### C

**Care Professional**
- A person who is a member of a profession regulated by a body mentioned in section 25(3) of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002

**Clinical decision**
- A decision taken by a clinician or other qualified care professional, in consultation with the patient, and with reference to local access policies and commissioning arrangements

**Consultant**
- A person contracted by a healthcare provider who has been appointed by a consultant appointment committee
- They must be a member of a Royal College or Faculty
- Consultant-led waiting times exclude non-medical scientists of equivalent standing (to a consultant) within diagnostic departments

**Consultant-led**
- A consultant retains overall clinical responsibility for the service, team or treatment
- The consultant will not necessarily be physically present for each patient's appointment, but they take overall clinical responsibility for patient care

**Convert(s) their UBRN**
- When an appointment has been booked via the NHS e-Referral Service, the UBRN is converted
- (Please see definition of UBRN)

### D

**DNA ‚Äì Did Not Attend**
- When a patient misses their appointment, it is referred to as a 'Did Not Attend' (DNA) or Was Not Brought (WNB)
- In the context of consultant-led waiting times, this is defined as where a patient fails to attend an appointment/admission without prior notice

**Direct access referral**
- Describes a situation where a GP, or other referrer, makes a referral for a diagnostic test with the intention that the responsibility for the patient remains with the GP and there is no intention for the patient to go on to see a consultant or consultant-led service at that stage

**Decision to admit**
- Where a clinical decision is taken to admit the patient for either day case or inpatient treatment

**Decision to treat**
- Where a clinical decision is taken to treat the patient
- This could be treatment as an inpatient or day case, but also includes treatments performed in other settings, for example, as an outpatient

### F

**First definitive treatment**
- An intervention intended to manage a patient's disease, condition or injury and avoid further intervention
- What constitutes first definitive treatment is a matter for clinical judgement, in consultation with others as appropriate, including the patient

**Fit and ready (in the context of bilateral procedures)**
- A new RTT clock should start once the patient is fit and ready for a subsequent bilateral procedure
- In this context, fit and ready means that the clock should start from the date that it is clinically appropriate for the patient to undergo that procedure, and from when the patient says they are available

### H

**Healthcare science intervention**
- See Therapy or Healthcare science intervention

### I

**Interface service (non consultant-led interface service)**
- All arrangements that incorporate any intermediary levels of clinical triage, assessment and treatment between traditional primary and secondary care
- Consultant-led referral to treatment relates to hospital/consultant-led care. Therefore, the definition of the term 'interface service' for the purpose of consultant-led waiting times does not apply to similar 'interface' arrangements established to deliver traditionally primary care or community provided services, outside of their traditional (practice or community based) setting

**The definition does not apply to:**
- Non consultant-led mental health services run by mental health trusts
- Referrals to 'practitioners with a special interest' for triage, assessment and possible treatment, except where they are working as part of a wider interface service type arrangements as described above

### N

**NHS e-Referral Service (formerly Choose and Book)**
- A national electronic referral service that gives patients a choice of place, date and time for their first consultant outpatient appointment in a hospital or clinic

**Non-admitted pathway**

**Non consultant-led**
- Where a consultant does not take overall clinical responsibility for the patient

**Non consultant-led interface service**
- See interface service

### P

**Patient pathway**
- A patient pathway is usually considered to be their journey from first contact with the NHS for an individual condition, through referral, diagnosis and treatment for that condition
- For chronic or recurrent conditions, a patient pathway will continue beyond the point at which first definitive treatment starts, as it will include further treatment for the same condition
- A person may therefore have multiple RTT periods (see Referral to treatment period) along one patient pathway
- NHS England often uses the term 'RTT pathway' in published reports and in this document and this is the same as an 'RTT period'

**Planned care**
- An appointment/procedure or series of appointments/procedures as part of an agreed programme of care which is required for clinical reasons to be carried out at a specific time or repeated at a specific frequency

### R

**Reasonable offer**
- An offer is reasonable where the offer for an outpatient appointment or an offer of admission is for a time and date three or more weeks from the time that the offer was made
- Pragmatic application of the guidance is encouraged, e.g. it is not reasonable to offer a patient a second date within the same week that they are on holiday

**Referral Management or assessment service**
- Referral management or assessment services are those that do not provide treatment, but accept GP (or other) referrals and provide advice on the most appropriate next steps for the place or treatment of the patient
- Depending on the nature of the service they may, or may not, physically see or assess the patient
- Should only be in place where they carry clinical support and abide by clear protocols that provide benefits to patients
- They must not be devices either to delay treatment or to avoid local clinical discussions about good referral practice
- A waiting time clock only starts on referral to a referral management and assessment service where that service may onward-refer the patient to a surgical or medical consultant-led service before responsibility is transferred back to the referring health professional

### Annex B: NHS England Data Validation Checks

The NHS England Operational Insights team runs monthly validation checks on RTT data submitted each month to identify noticeable data errors, such as missing data and large volume changes. The checks are run between provider submission deadline and close of collection. The Operational Insights team queries any issues with data contact at providers and issues are often resolved prior to close of collection and publication.

#### Routine Monthly Checks

| Check Category | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Data format validation** | ‚Ä¢ No negative or decimal numbers have been submitted<br>‚Ä¢ Providers have submitted data against valid commissioner codes |
| **Missing data** | ‚Ä¢ Missing data ‚Äì including not submitting all or part of RTT returns<br>‚Ä¢ Incorrect totals ‚Äì where total is sum over all treatment functions<br>‚Ä¢ If provider reports completed pathways, they also have incomplete pathways |
| **Volume changes** | ‚Ä¢ Large change in volumes compared to last month ‚Äì large increase or decrease for providers with more than minimum number of pathways<br>‚Ä¢ Return matches previous month, which indicates provider has mistakenly re-submitted previous month's return instead of current month<br>‚Ä¢ Larger than expected number of incomplete pathways<br>‚Ä¢ Large changes in 52+ week waiters |
| **Data consistency** | ‚Ä¢ Number of incomplete pathways with decision to admit is subset of total number of incomplete pathways<br>‚Ä¢ Sum of incomplete pathways in first four time-bands (0-4 weeks) is lower than number of new RTT periods |
| **Data quality flags** | ‚Ä¢ Large proportion of short (0 to 1 week) pathways ‚Äì where providers provide evidence that they have services that result in higher than usual proportions of short pathways they can be excluded from future checks<br>‚Ä¢ Large proportion of patients with unknown clock start |

#### Technical Details for Validation Checks

| Check | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Negative or decimal values** | Negative and decimal values are not allowed in any numeric field |
| **Invalid commissioner codes** | Commissioner codes must be current Sub-ICB code, specialised commissioning code or NONC (non-English commissioner) in aggregate monthly RTT data return *(Note: specific relevant commissioner code should be used for non-English commissioners in record-level WLMDS collection)* |
| **Missing data** | ‚Ä¢ Not submitted RTT18weeks return (neither Parts 1A, 1B, 2, 2A or 3)<br>‚Ä¢ Non-zero Part 1A (admitted), Part 1B (non-Admitted), Part 2 (incomplete), Part 2A (incomplete with DTA), or Part 3 (new RTT periods) for previous month, but have returned zero in relevant part this month<br>‚Ä¢ No incomplete/open pathways (data in part 1A or 1B but zeros in Part 2) |
| **Incorrect totals** | Incorrect totals in Part 1A (admitted), Part 1B (non-admitted), Part 2 (incomplete), Part 2A (incomplete w/ DTA), or Part 3 (new RTT periods) of RTT18weeks return ‚Äì this error is usually caused by corrupt templates |
| **Large change in volumes compared to last month** | ‚Ä¢ Part 1A (admitted) large difference compared to last month<br>‚Ä¢ Part 1B (non-admitted) large difference compared to last month<br>‚Ä¢ Part 2 (incomplete) large difference compared to last month<br>‚Ä¢ Part 2A (incomplete w/ DTA) large difference compared to last month<br>‚Ä¢ Part 3 (new RTT periods) large difference compared to last month |
| **No change in volumes compared to last month** | Part 1A, 1B, 2, 2A or 3 totals are identical to previous month |
| **Large number of incomplete pathways** | Part 2 (incomplete) total pathways is unexpectedly large |
| **Large change in volumes of 52+ week waiters compared to last month** | Part 2 (incomplete) large difference compared to last month |
| **Large number of incomplete pathways with a decision to admit** | Part 2A (incomplete w/ DTA) should be less than or equal to Part 2 (incomplete) |
| **Low number of new RTT periods** | Part 3 (New RTT periods) should be greater than or equal to sum of first for time-bands reported in Part 2 (incomplete) |
| **Large proportion of short (0 to 1 week) pathways** | ‚Ä¢ Part 1A (admitted) in 0-1 week time band is large proportion of total Part 1A (admitted) pathways<br>‚Ä¢ Part 1B (non-admitted) in 0-1 week time band is large proportion of total Part 1B (non-admitted) pathways |
| **Large proportion of patients with an unknown clock starts** | ‚Ä¢ Part 1A (admitted) unknown clock starts is large proportion of total Part 1A (admitted) pathways<br>‚Ä¢ Part 1B (non-admitted) unknown clock starts is large proportion of total Part 1B (non-admitted) pathways |

#### Additional Validation Checks

NHS England Operational Insights team also runs validation checks outside of usual collection and publication timetable. These checks identify issues that are not immediately obvious from raw data (such as unusual waiting list shapes) and often use analysis over longer period than monthly validation checks.

**Examples of additional checks include:**
- Looking at outliers
- Unexpected pathway distributions
- Consistency between completed and incomplete RTT pathways

---

### Annex C: Patient Pathway Identifiers

#### Assigning Patient Pathway Identifiers (PPIDs)

**Purpose:** A patient pathway identifier (PPID) should be assigned to pathway arising from referral for particular condition where this is referral within scope of RTT measure.

**Unique identification:** PPID, when combined with Organisation Code (of provider that issued PPID), will provide unique identifier for patient pathway allowing patient to be tracked along their RTT pathway and events along patient pathway (e.g., outpatient, diagnostic and inpatient events) to be linked so that RTT time can be calculated.

**Mandate:** DSCN 16/2009, published 27 August 2009, mandates that organisations flowing specific Commissioning Data Set (CDS) types must flow RTT data elements in Patient Pathway Data Group of those CDS Types to Secondary Uses Service (SUS) where those records relate to activity within scope of RTT measure.

**Submission requirement:** Organisations required to submit RTT data for events on RTT pathways that start on or after 1 December 2009 to SUS. Mandate also applies to any new CDS flows as they are established.

#### Patient Pathway Data Group Elements¬≤‚Å∂

| Data Element | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Unique booking reference number (converted)** | - |
| **Patient pathway identifier** | - |
| **Organisation code (patient pathway identifier issuer)** | Note: where initial referral was received via NHS e-Referral Service and UBRN is used as basis of PPID, then organisation code of PPID Issuer is X09 |
| **Referral to treatment period start date** | Note: ideally this flows on CDS record carrying first CDS-reported activity of pathway and does not have to be repeated on all subsequent events within pathway so long as PPID and Organisation Code of PPID Issuer are maintained and flow consistently |
| **Referral to treatment period end date** | Note: this only flows on CDS record carrying activity where patients RTT clock stopped |
| **Referral to treatment period status** | - |

#### PPID Generation and Management

**Initial generation:** At beginning of patient journey, first organisation receiving referral should generate Patient Pathway Identifier (which may be based on Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN)).

**Consistent usage:** This along with Organisation Code of that organisation (Organisation Code of PPID Issuer) should be used consistently to record unique identifier for pathway. Clock start date should also be recorded.

**Multi-provider pathways:** Where patient's RTT pathway or individual RTT periods within that pathway are delivered by more than one organisation, it is essential that same PPID and Organisation Code of PPID Issuer are applied - they do not change even where responsibility for patient care transfers to different organisation.

**NHS e-Referral Service:** Where NHS e-Referral Service is in place, UBRN should be used to create basis of identifier for pathway. In absence of NHS e-Referral Service, provider should generate PPID.

**CDS flow considerations:** In CDS flows, PPID and Organisation Code of PPID Issuer are separate fields, therefore, if organisation code forms part of generated PPID, then Organisation Code of PPID Issuer must also flow in separate specific field within CDS record for this purpose.

**Format requirements:** Data item Patient Pathway Identifier (PPID)¬≤‚Å∑ is alphanumeric field of length 20 characters. Important to ensure any locally defined PPID is of appropriate format for this field.

**Transfer requirements:** If patient is transferred to another provider during their RTT period, receiving provider should use same PPID and same Organisation Code of PPID Issuer. If UBRN is used as basis for PPID, then 12 character UBRN must be padded to ensure it meets required 20 character format required for submission to SUS.

**IPTAMDS transfer:** Therefore, full 20 characters, including any local padding, should be transferred between providers via Inter-Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS). See section 11 for more information on inter-provider transfers/multi-provider pathways.

#### Patient Pathways Including More Than One RTT Period

**Multiple RTT periods:** Person may have multiple RTT periods along one patient pathway. PPID may be used to support reporting of patient pathways that include more than one RTT period where those RTT periods relate to same underlying condition and same original referral. See section 13 for more information on terms RTT period and patient pathway.

**Unrelated referrals:** Where patient has more than one referral for unrelated clinical reasons, each referral will have its own patient pathway. Start of patient pathway may start first RTT period and there may be number of subsequent RTT periods along same patient pathway.

**Multiple RTT periods example:** Where patient pathway has two or more RTT periods, for example, patient with long term condition who has initial treatment, is subsequently monitored for several years before it is then decided that further treatment is required, decision to start substantively new or different treatment that does not already form part of that patient's agreed care plan will start new RTT period (rule 3c ‚Äì see section 3.4.2).

**Unique identification requirements:** Each RTT period on pathway can be uniquely identified by:
1. Patient pathway identifier (PPID) or UBRN-based PPID
2. Organisation code issuing PPID or UBRN (if UBRN is used the organisation code is X09)
3. RTT Period Start Date
4. Accurate recording of RTT Period Status Code for event at time of event

**Important note:** Start date for second (or subsequent) RTT period should NOT be associated with original referral date for first RTT period (as this would produce incorrect elongated RTT time).

#### Ensuring Locally Defined PPIDs Are Unique Nationally

**Non-NHS e-Referral Service pathways:** For non-NHS e-Referral Service pathways, provider receiving referral needs to generate number unique to provider and then use its organisation code to assure uniqueness. These two parts stay with patient through pathway so if patient gets tertiary referral to another provider their PPID still contains organisation code of initial provider.

**Conflict prevention:** In event of provider generating unique number already assigned by NHS e-Referral Service, organisation code element of PPID differentiates locally-generated PPI from NHS e-Referral Service generated PPID.

#### Patient Pathway Identifiers and Transferred Patients

**Multi-provider pathway measurement:** When measuring RTT pathways in SUS, important to ensure that PPIDs used for pathways that involve more than one provider are transferable between providers.

**Initial PPID generation:** At beginning of patient journey, first organisation receiving referral should generate Patient Pathway Identifier (which may be based on Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN)). This along with Organisation Code of that organisation (Organisation Code of PPID Issuer) should be used consistently to record unique identifier for pathway. Clock start date should also be recorded.

**Multi-provider consistency:** Where patient's RTT pathway or individual RTT periods within that pathway are delivered by more than one organisation, for RTT measurement in SUS it is essential that same PPID and Organisation Code of PPID Issuer are applied - they do not change even where responsibility for patient care transfers to different organisation.

**PPID format requirements:** Data item Patient Pathway Identifier defined in DSCN 18/2006 should be used to store PPID. This field is of length 20 and is alpha numeric. If you are defining PPIDs locally, important to ensure that they are in right format for this field so that they are transferable between providers.

**Local PPID uniqueness:** If you are using locally defined PPIDs in absence of NHS e-Referral Service, by taking your locally defined PPID and prefixing with your organisation code, this will ensure uniqueness when transferring to another provider.

#### Worked Example

**Scenario:** Patient with knee pain sees their GP and is referred to orthopaedic surgeon in secondary care. Consultant sees patient, diagnostic tests are performed and consultant agrees with patient that based on diagnostic results their care should be transferred to specialist centre.

**IPTAMDS requirements:** IPTAMDS must be completed and should be populated with mandated data items including:

| Data Item | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **20 character locally generated Patient Pathway Identifier** | Note: member of staff responsible for completing IPTAMDS must be aware that although on screen, they may be viewing, for example, 15 character PPID, PAS holds 20 character PPID and IPTAMDS must show full 20 characters |
| **Organisation Code of provider issuing PPID** | - |
| **RTT Status Code** | Referring provider should enter Status Code 20 on form to receiving provider. This allows receiving provider to ensure they are aware that RTT period remains open |
| **Local PAS update** | Referring provider should also enter RTT Status Code 21 on local PAS to nullify clock for PTL purposes at referring organisation since responsibility for patient and RTT period has now passed to receiving (tertiary) provider |

**Receiving provider actions:** On receipt of IPTAMDS, tertiary centre:
- Edits PPID field in their PAS to ensure that 20 character PPID present on IPTAMDS is entered
- Organisation Code of PPID Issuer is entered
- RTT Start Date is entered from IPTAMDS as date referral was received by secondary care provider from GP
- Enters RTT Status Code 20 on PAS unless patient is added directly to admission list for treatment or it is known that patient will receive their first definitive treatment at first outpatient attendance within tertiary centre
- Either of these will allow 'intended status' of 30 to be added to PAS
- Subsequent Admitted Patient Care or Outpatient CDS flows will carry actual RTT Status 30 in these examples

**NHS e-Referral Service via interface service:** For NHS e-Referral Service patients who are referred to secondary care via interface service, there may be more than one UBRN. When second UBRN is created along same RTT period, this will be linked with first UBRN and date of conversion of first UBRN will be date of RTT clock start. Clock keeps ticking whilst patient converts second UBRN. Interface service should monitor Appointment Slot Issue (ASI) work list to ensure that patients have booked their second onward appointment in timely manner.

### Annex D: RTT Status Codes and Use of Clinical Outcome Sheets

#### RTT Status Codes

**Definition:** RTT status is defined as 'the status of an activity (or anticipated activity) for the RTT period, decided by the lead care professional' or in other words:
- Whether each activity is part of RTT pathway or not
- Whether activity has started RTT clock, stopped RTT clock or continued existing ticking RTT clock

**Code sources:** There are 17 RTT statuses defined in DSCN 18/2006, however, some providers will use local codes which can be mapped to codes defined in DSCN 18/2006.

#### RTT Status Codes as Defined by DSCN 18/2006

##### Clock Starts
*The first activity in REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD where first treatment that is intended to manage PATIENT's disease, condition or injury will be subsequent activity*

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **10** | **first activity** - first activity in REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD¬≤‚Å∏ |
| **11** | **active monitoring end** - first activity at start of new REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD following active monitoring |
| **12** | **consultant referral** - first activity at start of new REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD following decision to refer directly to CONSULTANT for separate condition |

##### Clock Still Running
*Subsequent activity during REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD*

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **20** | **subsequent activity during REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD** - further activities anticipated |
| **21** | **transfer to another Health Care Provider** - subsequent activity during REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD anticipated by another Health Care Provider |

##### Clock Stops
*Activity that ends REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD*

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **30** | **first treatment** - start of first treatment that is intended to manage PATIENT's disease, condition or injury in REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD |
| **31** | **start of active monitoring initiated by PATIENT** |
| **32** | **start of active monitoring initiated by CARE PROFESSIONAL** |
| **33** | **failure to attend** - PATIENT failed to attend first CARE ACTIVITY after referral¬≤‚Åπ |
| **34** | **decision not to treat** - decision not to treat made or no further contact required |
| **35** | **PATIENT declined offered treatment** |
| **36** | **PATIENT died before treatment** |

##### Activity That Is Not Part of REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **90** | **after treatment** - first treatment occurred previously (for example, admitted as emergency from A&E or activity is after start of treatment) |
| **91** | **active monitoring** - CARE ACTIVITY during period of active monitoring |
| **92** | **not yet referred** - not yet referred for treatment, undergoing diagnostic tests by GP before referral |
| **98** | **not applicable** - ACTIVITY not applicable to REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIODS, for example, not consultant-led pathway |
| **99** | **not yet known** |

#### Use of Clinical Outcome Sheets

**Purpose:** To allow RTT measurement, RTT status should be recorded at each stage on patient journey by capturing information about what happened during each event.

**Outpatient decisions:** Many decisions about patient's treatment take place within outpatient setting and therefore it is essential that providers record RTT status of each patient as they leave their outpatient attendance.

**Implementation methods:** This can be done using clinical outcome sheets including electronic forms. Date of event also needs to be captured to allow RTT time to be calculated. RTT status data items then enable RTT start and stop times to be determined and hence measurement of length of RTT period.

**Format variation:** Format of clinical outcome sheets varies depending on particular clinic but important to record detail on outcome of outpatient attendance in terms of what had actually happened at attendance (for example, treatment in outpatients) and any intended next step on patient pathway.

**Beyond outpatient setting:** Providers should additionally consider recording of RTT events that occur beyond outpatient setting. Significant numbers of clinical decisions are taken without patient being in attendance (for example, by treating clinician following receipt of diagnostic test results) and consequently such RTT events are often missed. Simplified version of outcome form may be helpful in such circumstances.

**Local adaptation:** 17 RTT status codes listed above are those that should be used within information systems. Local areas may wish to use different description of codes on clinical outcome sheets including electronic forms. Alternatively some areas may wish to use different set of codes than those specified in DSCN, ensuring that locally defined set of codes can be locally mapped back to 17 RTT status codes defined in DSCN 18/2006.

**Local coding benefits:** Some providers have found it useful to use more detailed local outcome codes than 17 codes listed above as this has provided valuable clinical information for use locally.

**Interpretability:** Important point is to ensure that wording and descriptions used on clinical outcome sheets are interpretable by clinical and administrative staff. Clinical involvement in process of designing forms is essential. It may be helpful to provide 'scenario' guidance to aid clinician in completing form, for example, giving specialty specific examples of each of outcome options. Providers should also ensure that clinical outcome sheets relate to RTT training provided to staff.

**Data transfer:** Data from clinical outcome sheets is then transferred into local IT system. This is generally done by data clerks/administrators and often forms part of standard 'cashing up' and routine administrative tasks carried out during/after clinic.

**Reference:** See Annex E for more information on how Referral to Treatment Period Status is used in Commissioning Data Sets (CDS).

### Annex E: Referral to Treatment Period Status in Commissioning Data Sets (CDS) Submitted Through SUS

#### Which Sources of Referral Codes Start an RTT Clock?

**DSCN background:** DSCN 16/2007, published in May 2007, introduced new source of referral codes for outpatients to support implementation of RTT measurement.

**Complexity:** However, it is not possible to categorically state which source of referral codes do and do not start RTT pathway. Additional information will also be required before this can be established.

**Example:** Code 05 - consultant to consultant referral: if this was referral post-treatment or referral part-way along RTT pathway, then new RTT clock would not start. However if this was consultant to consultant referral for new condition, then new RTT clock would start.

**Solution:** By using clinic outcome sheets in outpatient clinics, this will allow you to capture additional information required to determine when new RTT clock starts, these may also be electronic forms.

#### Intended and Actual Status

**SUS reporting:** For purposes of RTT data submitted via Secondary Uses Service (SUS), Referral to Treatment Period Status indicates status at end of event that is flowing.

**IT system considerations:** However, some IT systems hold two fields: 'intended' status; and 'actual' status. So, for events where attendance has already happened, Commissioning Data Set (CDS) record would need to hold 'actual' status, in other words, status at end of appointment.

#### Referrals for Another Condition

**Dual recording requirement:** If, on clinic outcome sheet, RTT status is code 12 (patient is referred for separate condition), another outcome will also need to be recorded for current condition. In other words, clinic outcome sheet would record RTT status for original pathway, whether it is to be continued or ended.

**New pathway setup:** RTT status 12 starts new RTT pathway and this will need to be recorded with new pathway identifier. There may be space on clinic outcome sheet to record both these outcomes, if this is thought to be useful. If not you would have to have procedure for ensuring new pathway is set up on system and recorded. Referral letter to other clinician should generate new pathway identifier.

#### RTT Status Codes for RTT Clock Stops

**Treatment in outpatients:** For clock stops for treatment in outpatients or other consultant-led services, outcome signifying treatment should be recorded on clinical outcome sheet. Where RTT status codes defined in DCSN 18/2006 are being used, RTT status code '30 ‚Äì first treatment ‚Äì start of first treatment that is intended to manage PATIENT's disease, condition or injury in REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD' should be recorded in systems.

**Diagnostic admission with treatment:** If definitive treatment is given during what had originally been intended as diagnostic admission, outcome signifying treatment should be recorded. Where RTT status codes defined in DCSN 18/2006 are being used, RTT status code '30 ‚Äì first treatment ‚Äì start of first treatment that is intended to manage PATIENT's disease, condition or injury in REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PERIOD' should be recorded in systems.

**Transplant list:** Where RTT status codes defined in DCSN 18/2006 are being used, for clock stops due to patient being added to transplant list, RTT status code '34 ‚Äì Decision not to treat ‚Äì decision not to treat made or no further contact required' should be recorded in systems. Use of code 34 does not signify that patient should necessarily be discharged or returned to primary care ‚Äì in this scenario, it simply indicates that patient is no longer waiting electively (on waiting list) but is waiting on transplant list.

#### Active Monitoring Status Codes

**Two codes available:** Where RTT status codes defined in DCSN 18/2006 are being used, there are two RTT status codes that refer to clock stops for start of active monitoring:

- **31** - start of active monitoring initiated by PATIENT
- **32** - start of active monitoring initiated by CARE PROFESSIONAL

**Code 31 usage:** Should be used in scenarios where further intervention has been suggested by care professional but patient decides that they do not wish to pursue this at this stage.

**Code 31 example:** Consultant offers joint replacement operation to patient with osteoarthritis. However patient is not keen on invasive surgery at this stage as they view their symptoms as manageable. Patient and consultant agree to review patient's condition after 6 months and patient is placed on active monitoring.

**Code 32 usage:** Should be used in scenarios where care professional suggests period of active monitoring.

**Code 32 example:** Patient with back pain attends orthopaedic outpatient appointment. Spinal surgery is option but at this stage, patient's condition is not severe enough to require invasive surgery. Consultant wishes to monitor patient's condition for year with check-up appointment every 3 months. This is agreed with patient and period of active monitoring commences. This includes cases where patient is placed on active monitoring having declined two reasonable offers. Pragmatic application of guidance is encouraged, e.g. it is not reasonable to offer patient second date within same week that they are on holiday.

#### Administrative Events

**Definition:** For purposes of RTT data submitted via SUS, event which results in clock stop that occurs outside of events that are defined in CDS output (typically Outpatient or Inpatient encounters) is termed 'administrative event'.

**Submission method:** Administrative clock stops can be submitted via First Attendance field in Outpatient CDS type 020 where activity takes place outside face-to-face or telemedicine patient contact (Code 5 for First Attendance is 'Referral to Treatment administrative clock stop event').

**Code 5 usage:** Use of '5' for First Attendance field allows identification of RTT clock stop to avoid unnecessary appointment taking place and would encompass specific reasons list below:
- 31 - Active monitoring initiated by patient
- 32 - Active monitoring initiated by care professional
- 34 - Decision not to treat or no further contact required
- 35 - Patient declined offered treatment
- 36 - Patient died

#### Administrative Event Examples

**Example 1:** Patient attends appointment for diagnostic test. Test results are normal and therefore no further treatment required. This information is communicated to patient via telephone call from consultant's secretary: update patient RTT status to 34 (decision not to treat)

**Example 2:** Patient attends first outpatient appointment. Consultant suggests surgery will be best option and patient is added to inpatient waiting list. Several days later, patient decides they do not want to go ahead with surgery and calls hospital to cancel their proposed treatment and also declines any other treatment: update patient RTT status to 35 (patient declined offered treatment)

**Example 3:** Patient on RTT pathway dies and relative informs hospital that death has occurred: update patient RTT status to 36 (patient died before treatment)

#### Administrative Event Technical Requirements

**SUS functionality:** RTT clock stop administrative event functionality within SUS is such that administrative event record must be part of record containing required fields for accurate SUS RTT reporting and fields mandated by CDS schema. Details of these required fields may be found in NHS Data Dictionary.

**Required fields:** Record flowing such event which does not carry populated Patient Pathway Identifier, Organisation Code of PPI Issuer, RTT Period End Date and RTT Period Status Code attributes will not be applied in SUS RTT processing.

**Open periods only:** Administrative event will only be used to close open RTT periods (in other words, it is not possible to retrospectively adjust end date of closed RTT periods). Administrative event that cannot be matched to existing open RTT period will not be applied.

*Footnotes:*
26. These data items have been available since Dec 2007, as detailed in DSCN 18/2007 (superseded by ISB 0092 CDS6.2).
27. Defined in DSCN 18/2006.
28. Note that an event with an RTT status code of 10 is not needed to start an RTT period. The referral is the event that started the RTT period (with an RTT start date of the referral received date). The RTT status of 10 therefore indicates the 'first care event' (for example, first outpatient appointment), not the start event.
29. DNAs for a first appointment following the initial referral that started a waiting time clock nullify the patient's clock (in other words, it is removed from the numerator and denominator for Referral to Treatment time measurement purposes).
