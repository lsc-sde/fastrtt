**Yes**
The letter documents a clear clinical decision not to proceed with surgery (the definitive treatment) and confirms that the patient has agreed. Under NHS England RTT guidelines, a clock stops when a clinical decision not to treat is made and communicated to the patient and their GP. Therefore, this correspondence constitutes a clockâ€‘stop event.
