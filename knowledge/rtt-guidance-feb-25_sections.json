    "title": "1.1 Background",
    "content": "Waiting times matter to patients. Most patients want to be referred, diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.\n\nThe accurate recording and reporting of referral to treatment (RTT) waiting times information is extremely important. Patients can and do use this information to inform their choice of where to be referred and to understand how long they might expect to wait before starting their treatment.\n\nNHS providers and commissioners also need to use this information to ensure they are meeting their patients' legal right to start consultant-led non-emergency treatment within a maximum of 18 weeks from referral¹ – and to identify where action is needed to reduce inappropriately long waiting times.\n\nIn 2015, NHS England produced refreshed guidance to consolidate and simplify the previous published guidance and related advice².\n\nIn June 2015, Simon Stevens and the Secretary of State for Health accepted a recommendation from Sir Bruce Keogh³ that the incomplete pathway operational standard should became the sole measure of patients' constitutional right to start treatment within 18 weeks. As a result of the removal of the completed admitted pathway operational standard, there is no longer any provision to report pauses or suspensions in RTT waiting time clocks in monthly RTT returns to NHS England under any circumstances. This change is fully reflected in this guidance.\n\nThe changes to the reporting requirements effective from 2015 can be summarised as follows:\n\n- there is no longer a requirement to submit admitted adjusted data to NHS England\n- unadjusted admitted and non-admitted completed pathway data is still required but will no longer be used for monitoring against operational standards\n- the requirement to report incomplete pathway data remains unchanged – and has always been an unadjusted submission\n- two new data items have been added: incomplete pathways for patients with a decision to admit for treatment and new RTT periods.\n\nThe 2015 refresh also emphasised that those patients who choose to wait longer should have their wishes accommodated without being penalised. The tolerance of 8% set for achievement of the incomplete pathway waiting time operational standard is there to take account of the following situations that might lead to a longer waiting time:\n\n- patients who choose to wait longer for personal or social reasons (in some situations a clock stop for active monitoring may be appropriate for patients choosing to wait longer)\n- patients for whom it is clinically appropriate to wait longer (this does not include clinically complex patients who can and should start treatment within 18 weeks)\n- patients who fail to attend appointments they have agreed.\n\nThis guidance now also outlines the requirements for the monthly aggregate data collection from April 2021 data onwards⁴.\n\nIn January 2025, this guidance was updated to reflect NHS England's revised guidance on patients who choose to wait longer. The overall aim of the changes is to support providers to manage their waiting lists and resources more accurately and efficiently, by focusing on arranging treatment for patients who have been waiting a long time and who are available, while still protecting patients' rights to choose.\n\nThis guidance document is accompanied by a Frequently Asked Questions⁵ document.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that all decisions about a patient's waiting time should be made with the patient's best clinical interests in mind and in accordance with national legally binding RTT Rules⁶. NHS providers and commissioners are responsible for ensuring that both their local access policies and their standard operating procedures are in line with this guidance and the national RTT Rules⁷. This will ensure NHS staff record and report patients' waiting times correctly. Publication of local access policies will also ensure patients and relatives understand their waiting time rights and responsibilities – and what to do if they have waited too long.\n\nThis guidance continues to be essential reading for all staff responsible for managing the treatment of patients referred for non-emergency consultant-led treatment.\n\nThese include:\n\n- **referrers**, who can advise patients how long they may wait before starting treatment at different providers. Referrers also have an important role to play in raising patients' awareness of their maximum waiting time right and what they can do if they are concerned that they will wait too long before starting treatment;\n- **service managers and commissioners**, who need to ensure the data being reported is a true and honest reflection of waiting times and to assess whether the required standards are being delivered⁸, and to highlight where action is needed to reduce inappropriately long waiting times;\n- **hospital staff who record and report waiting times data** to ensure it is accurate and of high quality;\n- **chief executives / chief operating officers of providers**, who have primary responsibility for ensuring the waiting time data their organisation submits to NHS England is accurate⁹.",

The date on which the UBRN appears on this work list is the consultant-led RTT clock start. If there has been any previous activity against the UBRN (for example, a booking into a Clinical Assessment Service) it is the earlier date that starts the consultant-led RTT clock.\n\nFor referrals that are not made via the NHS e-Referral Service, the clock starts on the date that the referral is received by the provider organisation.\n\nIt is important that clock starts can be accurately identified for all patients on an RTT pathway, including pathways that involve more than one provider organisation. Providers will need to ensure that they identify all inter-provider referrals clearly, as the clock start date for these referrals will NOT be the date subsequent providers receive the referral (see section 11).\n\nAll pathways reported should have a known clock start. Patients with no known clock start should still be reported. It is the responsibility of the receiving provider to take appropriate action to identify a correct start date, which may include discussion with the patient.",

Please see section 6 for a full definition of interface services and more information on how RTT applies to these services.\n\nFor NHS e-Referral Service patients who are referred to secondary care via an interface service, there may be two UBRNs associated with the same pathway. When a second UBRN is created along the same RTT period this will be linked with the first UBRN and the date of conversion of the first UBRN will be the date of the RTT clock start. The RTT clock keeps ticking whilst the patient converts the second UBRN. The interface service should monitor their Worklists to ensure that patients have booked their second onward appointment in a timely manner. The identifier for the pathway will be the first UBRN and not the second UBRN.\n\nThere may also be the situation where the GP refers to an interface service not through the NHS e-Referral Service but as a paper referral and the interface service refers on to a Provider using the NHS e-Referral Service. In this scenario, the URBN conversion date would not be the RTT start. The Inter Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS) should be attached with the NHS e-Referral Service referral so that the correct start date (the date that the original GP referral was received by the interface service) can be obtained by the receiving provider (see section 11).",

However, where a patient is referred for diagnostics or specialist opinion with a view to treatment it may be more appropriate to start the new clock at this point (onward referral date).\n\nWhere the patient will be remaining under the care of the same consultant or under the care of a different consultant within the same provider, then the date of the decision to refer and the referral being received will be the same.\n\nHowever, where a patient is referred to a different provider for the new treatment, then the RTT clock will not start until the referral is received by the receiving provider. As patients will perceive their wait as starting from the time that the consultant told them they were going to refer, there should not be a significant delay between the date the decision to refer was made (and communicated to the patient) and the date that the referral is received in the receiving provider.\n\nA clock start of this type can occur at any follow-up outpatient appointment including during a routine follow-up of a patient with a long-term condition.

If the patient wishes to go ahead with their pathway, the provider should offer a new date acting as if the patient is on the waiting list at the point which they previously left – that is, they should not be returned to the beginning of the waiting list but they will have a new clock start at the date of decision to go ahead following a period of active monitoring.\n\nAs with new clock starts for substantively new or different treatments, in some cases it may be appropriate to start a new clock before a 'decision to treat' is made, where, for example, there has been a decision to refer a patient for diagnostics/specialist opinion with a view to starting treatment.

If the clinician indicates another first appointment should be offered before the patient contacts the trust to rebook, a new RTT clock will be started on the date this decision is made.

However, clinical coding may not be timely enough for the purposes of RTT measurement. Therefore, business processes should be put in place to allow the identification of diagnostic admissions.\n\nFor inpatient/day case admissions for first definitive treatment, the clock stops on the date that the admission occurs. It is recognised that in some cases treatment may not start until the day after admission (or possibly later). However, for simplicity and pragmatism, the clock stop should be recorded as the admission date.\n\nIf the patient is admitted for first definitive treatment but the treatment is not carried out, then the clock should not be stopped unless a clinical decision is made that the patient no longer requires treatment. Examples include:\n\ni. Patient admitted for first definitive treatment on 1 February. Surgery cancelled (due to lack of theatre availability). Patient sent home with new TCI date of 5 February. RTT clock should not stop until the day of admission for the surgery when it is eventually carried out.\n\nii. Patient admitted for first definitive treatment on 1 February. Surgery cancelled (patient is temporarily unfit due to chest infection). Patient sent home with a new TCI date of 10 February. RTT clock should not stop until the day of admission for the surgery when it is eventually carried out.\n\niii. Patient admitted for first definitive treatment on 1 February. After admission, it is discovered that patient is not clinically suitable for operation. Situation is discussed with patient, and it is agreed that the surgery will not be carried out. Patient is discharged back to primary care. In this scenario, this is a non-admitted clock stop when a clinical decision not to treat is made and communicated to the patient.",

Patients who rearrange their appointments in advance (irrespective of how short the period of notice they give) should not be classed as a DNA.\n\nIf a patient DNAs their first appointment following the initial referral that started their RTT clock, provided that the provider can demonstrate that the appointment was clearly communicated to the patient, this will nullify the RTT clock (in other words, it is removed from the numerator and denominator for RTT measurement purposes).\n\nPatient DNAs at any other point on the RTT pathway will not stop the RTT clock, unless the patient is being discharged back to the care of their GP. The action of discharging the patient will stop the clock provided that:\n\ni. the provider can demonstrate that the appointment was clearly communicated to the patient;\nii. discharging the patient is not contrary to their best clinical interests, which may only be determined by a clinician;\niii. discharging the patient is carried out according to local, publicly available, policies on DNAs;\niv. These local policies are clearly defined and specifically protect the clinical interests of vulnerable patients (for example, children) and are agreed with clinicians, commissioners, patients and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nIf the above criteria are fulfilled, then the RTT clock stops on the date that the patient is discharged back to the care of their GP.\n\nProviders should agree and publish local DNA policies that are in line with the spirit of the guidance. For example, a 'two strikes and out' policy applied without satisfying the above criteria would not be acceptable. Examples of the application of a local policy:\n\nFor first appointments on an RTT pathway:\ni. if the patient DNAs, their RTT clock can be stopped and nullified on the date of the DNA'd appointment having fulfilled the criteria described above;\nii. if the patient DNAs but the provider chooses to rebook the patient, then their original RTT clock would be stopped and nullified on the date of the DNA'd appointment and a new clock would start (at zero) on the date that the provider decides to offer another appointment, having fulfilled the criteria described above.\n\nFor subsequent appointments on an RTT pathway:\ni. if the patient DNAs and the provider returns the patient back to primary care (having fulfilled the criteria described above), then their RTT clock would stop on the date of the DNA'd appointment;\nii. if the patient DNAs but the provider chooses to rebook the patient, then their existing RTT clock would continue to tick.\n\nLocal DNA policies must be clearly defined and published, and specifically protect the clinical interests of vulnerable patients (for example, children) and be agreed with clinicians, commissioners, patients and other relevant stakeholders.

    "content": "An RTT clock may be stopped where it is clinically appropriate to start a period of monitoring in secondary care without further clinical intervention or diagnostic procedures at that stage. The clock stops on the date that the clinical decision is made and communicated with the patient.\n\nA new RTT clock would start when a decision to treat is made following a period of active monitoring.\n\nWhere there is a clinical reason why it is not appropriate to continue to treat the patient at that stage, but to discharge the patient back to primary care for ongoing management, then this constitutes a decision not to treat and should be recorded as such and stops an RTT clock.\n\nActive monitoring may apply at any point in the patient's pathway. The definition of active monitoring was carefully drawn up with input from national clinical leads. It is designed to ensure that national measurement of patients' waiting times reflects the realities of clinical decision-making.\n\nIn general, if during active monitoring a decision to start a substantively new or different treatment that does not already form part of the patient's agreed care plan is made, then a new RTT clock would start. The clock starts on the date that the decision is made and communicated with the patient.\n\nReasons why patients may be placed into a period of hospital-initiated active monitoring which would stop their clock include:\n\n- when the most clinically appropriate option is for the patient to be actively monitored over a period of time, rather than to undergo any further tests, treatments or other clinical interventions at that time\n- when a patient wishes to delay their pathway and declines 2 offers of reasonable¹⁵ dates, the clinician may decide to start a period of active monitoring, following a clinical conversation with and the agreement of the patient. Where a patient declares a period of unavailability (for example, a teacher wishes to wait until the school holidays for treatment), it may not be appropriate to offer specific dates within this period (as it is known that the patient will not be able to attend). In this situation, active monitoring should not be considered unless 2 reasonable dates could have been offered during the period of declared unavailability\n- when a patient declines 2 reasonable offers of dates for earlier appointment or admission at an alternative provider, the clinician may decide to start a period of active monitoring, following a clinical conversation with and the agreement of the patient. Before offering dates at an alternative provider, the trust should have determined that it would be clinically and socially appropriate for the patient to be seen at the alternative provider. A reasonable alternative provider should be agreed on a case-by-case basis, recognising geographical and social factors, and offers must state details of the date, provider and team. Pragmatic application of active monitoring guidance is encouraged.\n\nPatients may also initiate the start of a period of active monitoring – for example, by choosing to decline treatment to see how they cope with their symptoms. When patients decide to delay their pathway there should be clinical oversight, and steps should be taken to ensure that the patient fully understands the clinical implications of the delay. Throughout the agreed active monitoring period the patient should be advised of the process to follow should they wish to go ahead with treatment and be reinstated on the waiting list. Once the patient wishes to go ahead, the provider should offer a new date, acting as if the patient is on the waiting list at the point that they previously left.\n\nStopping a patient's clock for a period of active monitoring requires careful consideration on a case-by-case basis and its use needs to be consistent with the patient's perception of their wait. For example, stopping a clock to actively monitor a patient in the knowledge that some form of diagnostic or clinical intervention will be required in a couple of days is unlikely to make sense to a patient, as they are likely to perceive their wait as being one continuous period from the time of their initial referral. Its use is more appropriate where a longer period of active monitoring is required before any further action is needed.\n\n**Patient 'thinking time'**\n\nWhere a patient is given 'thinking time'¹⁶ by the consultant, the effect on the RTT clock will depend on the individual scenario. If the agreed 'thinking time' is short, then the RTT clock should continue to tick. An example is where invasive surgery is offered as the proposed first definitive treatment, but the patient would like a few days to consider this before confirming they wish to go ahead with the surgery. Providers are encouraged to ensure a discussion with the patient takes place where more than 14 days have passed without next steps being agreed.\n\nIf a longer period of 'thinking time' is agreed, then active monitoring¹⁷ is more appropriate. An example is where the clinician offers a surgical intervention, but the patient is not keen on invasive surgery at this stage, as they view their symptoms as manageable. A review appointment is agreed for three months' time and the patient is placed on active monitoring. The RTT clock would stop at the point that the decision is made to commence active monitoring. A new RTT clock would start when a decision to treat is made following a period of active monitoring.\n\n**Active monitoring and diagnostic tests**\n\nFor patients on active monitoring, routine or regular diagnostic check-ups (for example, six-monthly check cystoscopy) would not start a new RTT clock. However, if the outcome of a routine diagnostic check was that further treatment was now required, then this would start a new RTT clock, on the date that this decision was made and communicated to the patient.",

In this situation, active monitoring should not be considered unless two reasonable dates could have been offered during the period of declared unavailability.\n- Where a patient wishes to delay their pathway by more than six weeks, a clinical review should take place.\n- Where it is appropriate to place a patient on active monitoring, patients should be clinically reviewed every 12 weeks.\n- If a patient is to potentially be placed on active monitoring the RTT clock should be stopped when there is a decision agreed by both the patient and clinician to start a period of active monitoring.\n- Patients placed on active monitoring should be managed through local reporting and local clinical governance arrangements.\n- Throughout the agreed active monitoring period the patient should be advised of the process to follow should they wish to continue their pathway and be reinstated on the waiting list.\n\nIf a patient wishes to continue their pathway, the provider should offer a new date acting as if the patient is on the RTT waiting list at the point which they previously left, i.e. they should not be returned to the beginning of the waiting list. A new clock should start on the date that the patient decides to go ahead.\n\n---",

    "title": "9.1 RTT data quality assurance checklist",
    "content": "The following checklist is a useful guide for all NHS organisations providing consultant-led services to assure the quality of the RTT data they submit. Organisations that cannot answer yes to each question will need to address the issues raised.\n\n**Have referral dates and other RTT clock starts been recorded for all your patients?**\n\nWithout knowing clock starts for all patients NHS organisations will not know where each patient is on their RTT pathway. Good waiting list management – treating patients according to their clinical priority and then in the order in which they were added to the list – requires that clock starts are properly recorded. This includes referrals through Electronic Referral Service (eRS) and Referral Assessment Service (RAS) where they have not yet been booked but may appear on Appointment Slot Issue worklists or equivalent.\n\n**Do you know the original referral dates/clock starts for all patients transferred to you from other hospitals or interface services?**\n\nThe waiting times standards apply equally to patients who transfer between hospitals and from interface services. It is mandatory for all organisations to transfer the Inter Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS) for patients as they move between organisations, so that key information, for example about clock starts, transfers with them.\n\n**Do your systems capture the end of all RTT pathways?**\n\nAn RTT clock stops when:\n- the patient starts consultant-led treatment;\n- the patient starts therapy or healthcare science intervention as decided by a consultant;\n- the patient is added to a national transplant waiting list;¹⁸\n- the patient is returned to primary care for non consultant-led treatment;\n- a decision is made to start a period of active monitoring by the consultant and the patient;\n- the patient declines treatment;\n- a clinical decision is made not to treat;\n- the patient is discharged by their clinician back into the care of their GP.\n\nOrganisations must have mechanisms in place to capture and report the end of all pathways. To record this information most providers have implemented systems which record clinical outcomes in outpatient clinics and also to capture clinical decisions made outside of clinics.\n\n**Do you know how many clock starts are due to planned patients not being seen in time?**\n\nSection 5 outlines the circumstances when a new waiting time clock should start when planned admission for treatment does not start within appropriate clinical timescales. Ideally no new clock would start, as the patient should not wait beyond the clinically appropriate date.\n\n**Are any emergency admissions mistakenly being included in the RTT return?**\n\nPatients whose pathway commences as an emergency presentation (typically but not exclusively through an A&E or minor injuries department) should not be included within RTT reports, unless and until a decision to refer for further elective diagnostic tests or treatment is made.\n\n**Do you review waits over 18 weeks?**\n\nThis is important as it will inform you why these occurred and enable you to take action to avoid unnecessary long waits for your patients in the future.\n\n**Is your total list size increasing? Or are your clearance times increasing?**\n\nAn increasing list size or clearance time may be an early warning sign for a commissioner and its provider that the number of patients being referred is out of balance with the capacity being provided - and that waiting times are at risk of increasing.\n\nClearance times provide a means for assessing the relative size of a waiting list and are calculated by comparing the number of patients waiting, with a typical week's RTT activity. Clearance times are expressed as the number of weeks it would notionally take to treat the stock of incomplete pathways if no new clocks were started, and clocks continue to be stopped at the current rate. The NHS England Operational Insights team can provide advice on calculating clearance times and can be contacted via england.rtt@nhs.net.\n\n---",

However, in exceptional circumstances, where a provider has no confidence in the accuracy of its RTT data, it may be appropriate to suspend reporting.\n\nThe decision to suspend the submission of data needs to be a decision taken and owned by the board of a provider. The expectation is that the plan to resolve the problem and oversight of the associated mitigating actions, will be a key issue for the Board to monitor closely until the issues are completely resolved.\n\nThe decision by a provider not to submit data returns is a serious one and should not be taken lightly as the likely impact on an organisation can be significant. The NHS trust will be highlighted in any national publications as not being able to submit data.\n\n---",

For multi-provider pathways (for example, pathways that involve a transfer to a tertiary centre), the RTT measurement and reporting baton passes with the clinical responsibility baton.

There is no longer any central requirement for provider A to track the patient's RTT time²⁴. However, they may want to make a local arrangement that provider B keeps them informed of the patient's progress.\n\nIf provider A refers the patient to provider B simply for a diagnostic or opinion and provider A is retaining overall clinical responsibility, then provider A retains the measurement baton and should continue to report the patient on their RTT return and PTL.",

    "content": "It is important that the correct start date is captured for patients who transfer from interface services to secondary care providers and from provider to provider.\n\nThe Inter-Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS) aids providers receiving patients mid-way along their RTT pathway, including tertiary centres. The purpose of the IPTAMDS is to ensure that the administrative RTT data required to enable the receiving provider to report on the patient pathway is transferred from the referring provider to the receiving provider when responsibility for a patient's care has transferred. In particular, the referring provider must ensure that the patient's initial RTT clock start date forms part of the onward referral information to ensure that patients' waiting times are correctly recorded and that they are treated within maximum waiting times.\n\nFor RTT pathways, use of the IPTAMDS is mandatory for transfers between interface services and secondary care providers, as well as transfers between secondary and tertiary providers. In particular, an IPTAMDS is mandated for completion when:\n\ni. The care of a patient on an RTT pathway transfers between healthcare providers. This includes transfers to and from Independent Sector providers where this transfer is part of NHS commissioned care.\nii. A request for a clinical opinion results in the patient's care being transferred to an alternative provider.\niii. RTT pathways are commissioned by English NHS commissioners independent of location.\n\n**Example of the use of IPTAMDS for a patient transferring from an interface service:**\n- patient's original referral from GP was received by an interface service on 2 January; after carrying out initial assessment, the interface service decided to refer patient on to an acute provider for treatment;\n- the acute provider receives referral on 28 January;\n- the acute provider should record the RTT start date for this patient as 2 January, not 28 January.\n\n**Example of the use of IPTAMDS for a provider-to-provider transfer:**\n- patient's original referral from GP was received by provider A on 2 January; after carrying out initial assessment, provider A decided to refer patient on to a tertiary provider (provider B) for treatment;\n- provider B receives referral on 28 January;\n- provider B should record the RTT start date for this patient as 2 January, not 28 January.\n\nFurther information on the IPTAMDS can be found in Data Set Change Notices (DSCN) 44/2007 and 07/2008, which can be found at: https://digital.nhs.uk/isce/publication/dcb0095.\n\nFurther information on the use of Patient Pathway Identifiers (PPIDs) and transferred patients and a worked example of how to handle PPIDs for transferred patients is in Annex C.\n\n---",

When a referral is forwarded or deferred, it will appear on that provider's appointment slot issues (ASI) worklist.\n\n**B**\n\n**Bilateral (procedure)**\nA procedure that is performed on both sides of the body, at matching anatomical sites. For example, removal of cataracts from both eyes.\n\n**C**\n\n**Care Professional**\nA person who is a member of a profession regulated by a body mentioned in section 25(3) of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002.\n\n**Clinical decision**\nA decision taken by a clinician or other qualified care professional, in consultation with the patient, and with reference to local access policies and commissioning arrangements.\n\n**Consultant**\nA person contracted by a healthcare provider who has been appointed by a consultant appointment committee. They must be a member of a Royal College or Faculty. Consultant-led waiting times exclude non-medical scientists of equivalent standing (to a consultant) within diagnostic departments.\n\n**Consultant-led**\nA consultant retains overall clinical responsibility for the service, team or treatment. The consultant will not necessarily be physically present for each patient's appointment, but they take overall clinical responsibility for patient care.\n\n**Convert(s) their UBRN**\nWhen an appointment has been booked via the NHS e-Referral Service, the UBRN is converted. (Please see definition of UBRN).\n\n**D**\n\n**DNA – Did Not Attend**\nWhen a patient misses their appointment, it is referred to as a 'Did Not Attend' (DNA) or Was Not Brought (WNB).). In the context of consultant-led waiting times, this is defined as where a patient fails to attend an appointment/ admission without prior notice.\n\n**Direct access referral**\nDescribes a situation where a GP, or other referrer, makes a referral for a diagnostic test with the intention that the responsibility for the patient remains with the GP and there is no intention for the patient to go on to see a consultant or consultant-led service at that stage.\n\n**Decision to admit**\nWhere a clinical decision is taken to admit the patient for either day case or inpatient treatment.\n\n**Decision to treat**\nWhere a clinical decision is taken to treat the patient. This could be treatment as an inpatient or day case, but also includes treatments performed in other settings, for example, as an outpatient.\n\n**F**\n\n**First definitive treatment**\nAn intervention intended to manage a patient's disease, condition or injury and avoid further intervention. What constitutes first definitive treatment is a matter for clinical judgement, in consultation with others as appropriate, including the patient.\n\n**Fit and ready (in the context of bilateral procedures)**\nA new RTT clock should start once the patient is fit and ready for a subsequent bilateral procedure. In this context, fit and ready means that the clock should start from the date that it is clinically appropriate for the patient to undergo that procedure, and from when the patient says they are available.\n\n**H**\n\n**Healthcare science intervention**\nSee Therapy or Healthcare science intervention.\n\n**I**\n\n**Interface service (non consultant-led interface service)**\nAll arrangements that incorporate any intermediary levels of clinical triage, assessment and treatment between traditional primary and secondary care.\n\nConsultant-led referral to treatment relates to hospital/consultant-led care. Therefore, the definition of the term 'interface service' for the purpose of consultant-led waiting times does not apply to similar 'interface' arrangements established to deliver traditionally primary care or community provided services, outside of their traditional (practice or community based) setting.\n\nThe definition of the term does not also apply to:\n- non consultant-led mental health services run by mental health trusts.\n- referrals to 'practitioners with a special interest' for triage, assessment and possible treatment, except where they are working as part of a wider interface service type arrangements as described above.\n\n**N**\n\n**NHS e-Referral Service (formerly Choose and Book)**\nA national electronic referral service that gives patients a choice of place, date and time for their first consultant outpatient appointment in a hospital or clinic.\n\n**Non-admitted pathway**\nA pathway that results in a clock stop for treatment that does not require an admission or for 'non-treatment'.\n\n**Non consultant-led**\nWhere a consultant does not take overall clinical responsibility for the patient.\n\n**Non consultant-led interface service**\nSee interface service.\n\n**P**\n\n**Patient pathway**\nA patient pathway is usually considered to be their journey from first contact with the NHS for an individual condition, through referral, diagnosis and treatment for that condition. For chronic or recurrent conditions, a patient pathway will continue beyond the point at which first definitive treatment starts, as it will include further treatment for the same condition. A person may therefore have multiple RTT periods (see Referral to treatment period) along one patient pathway. NHS England often uses the term 'RTT pathway' in published reports and in this document and this is the same as an 'RTT period'.\n\n**Planned care**\nAn appointment /procedure or series of appointments/ procedures as part of an agreed programme of care which is required for clinical reasons to be carried out at a specific time or repeated at a specific frequency.\n\n**R**\n\n**Reasonable offer**\nAn offer is reasonable where the offer for an outpatient appointment or an offer of admission is for a time and date three or more weeks from the time that the offer was made. Pragmatic application of the guidance is encouraged, e.g. it is not reasonable to offer a patient a second date within the same week that they are on holiday.\n\n**Referral Management or assessment service**\nReferral management or assessment services are those that do not provide treatment, but accept GP (or other) referrals and provide advice on the most appropriate next steps for the place or treatment of the patient. Depending on the nature of the service they may, or may not, physically see or assess the patient.\n\nReferral Management and Assessment Services should only be in place where they carry clinical support and abide by clear protocols that provide benefits to patients. They must not be devices either to delay treatment or to avoid local clinical discussions about good referral practice.\n\nA waiting time clock only starts on referral to a referral management and assessment service where that service may onward-refer the patient to a surgical or medical consultant-led service before responsibility is transferred back to the referring health professional.\n\n**Referral to treatment period**\nAn RTT period is the time between a person's referral to a consultant-led service, which initiates a clock start, and the point at which the clock stops for any of the reasons set out in the RTT national clock rules, for example the start of first definitive treatment or a decision that treatment is not appropriate.\n\n**S**\n\n**Straight to test**\nFor certain pathways clinicians are able to refer patients directly for a diagnostic test, bypassing the traditional initial hospital outpatient appointment.\n\n**Substantively new or different treatment**\nUpon completion of a consultant-led referral to treatment period, a new waiting time clock starts upon the decision to start a substantively new or different treatment that does not already form part of that patient's agreed care plan.\n\nIt is recognised that a patient's care often extends beyond the consultant-led referral to treatment period, and that there may be a number of planned treatments beyond first definitive treatment.\n\nHowever, where further treatment is required that did not form part of the patient's original treatment plan, a new waiting time clock should start at the point the decision to treat is made.\n\nScenarios where this might apply include:\n- where less 'invasive/intensive' forms of treatment have been unsuccessful and more 'aggressive/intensive' treatment is required (for example, where Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI) has been unsuccessful and a decision is made to refer for IVF treatment);\n- patients attending regular follow up outpatient appointments, where a decision is made to try a substantively new or different treatment. In this context, a change to the dosage of existing medication may not count as substantively new or different treatment, whereas a change to medication combined with a decision to refer the patient for therapy might.\n\nUltimately, the decision about whether the treatment is substantively new or different from the patient's agreed care plan is one that must be made locally by a care professional in consultation with the patient.\n\n**T**\n\n**TCI**\nTo come in date or the date offered for admission to hospital.\n\n**Therapy or Healthcare science intervention**\nWhere a consultant-led or interface service decides that therapy (for example physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, podiatry, counselling) or healthcare science (for example, hearing aid fitting) is the best way to manage the patient's disease, condition or injury and avoid further interventions.\n\n**U**\n\n**UBRN (Unique Booking Reference Number)**\nThe reference number that a patient receives on their appointment request letter when generated by the referrer through the NHS e-Referral Service. The UBRN is used in conjunction with the patient password to make or change an appointment.\n\n**W**\n\n**Was Not Brought (WNB)**\nWhen a patient misses their appointment, it is referred to as a 'Did Not Attend' (DNA) or Was Not Brought (WNB).). In the context of consultant-led waiting times, this is defined as where a patient fails to attend an appointment/ admission without prior notice.\n\n---\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ As stated in the NHS Constitution: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england\n\n² A list of the documents consolidated into this refreshed guidance is available in Annex A.\n\n³ http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/letter-waiting-time-standards-sbk.pdf\n\n⁴ See section 10.1.1.3 Changes to existing data collection template – from April 2021 for more detail.\n\n⁵ See Statistics » Consultant-led Referral to Treatment Waiting Times Rules and Guidance (england.nhs.uk)\n\n⁶ http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2996/pdfs/uksi_20122996_en.pdf\n\n⁷ https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-start-consultant-led-treatment-within-18-weeks\n\n⁸ NHS England » NHS operational planning and contracting guidance\n\n⁹ https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/321492/9781474106672_WEB.PDF\n\n¹⁰ DNAs for a first appointment following the initial referral that started a waiting time clock nullify the patient's clock (in other words, it is removed from the numerator and denominator for Referral to Treatment time measurement purposes).\n\n¹¹ https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-start-consultant-led-treatment-within-18-weeks\n\n¹² https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-start-consultant-led-treatment-within-18-weeks\n\n¹³ See Annex D for more information on the use of RTT Status Codes for clock stops resulting from administrative events.\n\n¹⁴ The NHS Constitution (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england) sets out the rights to which patients, public and staff are entitled, together with responsibilities, which the public, patients and staff owe to one another to ensure that the NHS operates fairly and effectively.\n\n¹⁵ Patients should be given 3 weeks' notice for appointments.

This along with the Organisation Code of that organisation (the Organisation Code of the PPID Issuer) should be used consistently to record the unique identifier for the pathway. The clock start date should also be recorded. Where the patient's RTT pathway or individual RTT periods within that pathway are delivered by more than one organisation, it is essential that the same PPID and Organisation Code of PPID Issuer are applied, in other words, they do not change even where the responsibility for patient care transfers to a different organisation.\n\nWhere the NHS e-Referral Service is in place, the UBRN should be used to create the basis of the identifier for the pathway. In the absence of the NHS e-Referral Service, the provider should generate a PPID. Note that in CDS flows, the PPID and the Organisation Code of PPID Issuer are separate fields, therefore, if the organisation code forms part of the generated PPID, then the Organisation Code of the PPID Issuer must also flow in the separate specific field within the CDS record for this purpose.\n\nThe data item Patient Pathway Identifier (PPID)[^27] is an alphanumeric field of length 20 characters. It is important to ensure that any locally defined PPID is of an appropriate format for this field. If the patient is transferred to another provider during their RTT period, the receiving provider should use the same PPID and the same Organisation Code of PPID Issuer. If the UBRN is used as the basis for the PPID, then the 12 character UBRN must be padded to ensure it meets the required 20 character format required for submission to SUS. Therefore, the full 20 characters, including any local padding, should be transferred between providers via the Inter-Provider Transfer Administrative Minimum Data Set (IPTAMDS).

The PPID may be used to support reporting of patient pathways that include more than one RTT period where those RTT periods relate to the same underlying condition and the same original referral. See section 13 for more information on the terms RTT period and patient pathway.\n\nWhere a patient has more than one referral for unrelated clinical reasons, each referral will have its own patient pathway. The start of the patient pathway may start the first RTT period and there may be a number of subsequent RTT periods along the same patient pathway.\n\nFigure B illustrates how one patient could have multiple concurrent pathways and each pathway can have multiple RTT periods along it, but that the RTT periods in a pathway cannot be concurrent.\n\nWhere a patient pathway has two or more RTT periods, for example, a patient with a long term condition who has an initial treatment, is subsequently monitored for several years before it is then decided that further treatment is required, the decision to start a substantively new or different treatment that does not already form part of that patient's agreed care plan will start a new RTT period (rule 3c – see section 3.4.2). However, this will be for the same condition that initial treatment was given several years earlier. It is important to ensure that each RTT period can be uniquely identified. Each RTT period on the pathway can be uniquely identified by:\n\n1. Patient pathway identifier (PPID) or UBRN- based PPID\n2. Organisation code issuing the PPID or UBRN (if a UBRN is used the organisation code is X09 [to be updated])\n3. RTT Period Start Date\n4. Accurate recording of the RTT Period Status Code for the event at the time of the event\n\nThe start date for the second (or subsequent) RTT period should not be associated with the original referral date for the first RTT period (as this would produce an incorrect elongated RTT time).",

The consultant sees the patient, diagnostic tests are performed and the consultant agrees with the patient that based on the diagnostic results that their care should be transferred to a specialist centre. The IPTAMDS must be completed and should be populated with the mandated data items including:\n\n- **20 character locally generated Patient Pathway Identifier** – note that the member of staff responsible for completing the IPTAMDS must be aware that although on screen, he/she may be viewing, for example, a 15 character PPID, the PAS holds a 20 character PPID and the IPTAMDS must show the full 20 characters\n- **Organisation Code of the provider issuing the PPID**\n- **RTT Status Code** – the referring provider should enter Status Code 20 on the form to the receiving provider. This allows the receiving provider to ensure that they are aware that the RTT period remains open\n- The referring provider should also enter RTT Status Code 21 on the local PAS in order to nullify the clock for PTL purposes at the referring organisation since responsibility for the patient and the RTT period has now passed to the receiving (tertiary) provider\n\nOn receipt of the IPTAMDS, the tertiary centre edits the PPID field in their PAS to ensure that the 20 character PPID present on the IPTAMDS is entered, the Organisation Code of the PPID Issuer is entered and the RTT Start Date is entered from the IPTAMDS as the date the referral was received by the secondary care provider from the GP.\n\nThe tertiary centre enters RTT Status Code 20 on the PAS unless the patient is added directly to an admission list for treatment or it is known that the patient will receive their first definitive treatment at the first outpatient attendance within the tertiary centre. Either of these will allow the 'intended status' of 30 to be added to PAS. Subsequent Admitted Patient Care or Outpatient CDS flows will carry the actual RTT Status 30 in these examples.\n\nFor NHS e-Referral Service (formerly Choose & Book) patients who are referred to secondary care via an interface service, there may be more than one UBRN. When a second UBRN is created along the same RTT period, this will be linked with the first UBRN and the date of conversion of the first UBRN will be the date of the RTT clock start. The clock keeps ticking whilst the patient converts the second UBRN. The interface service should monitor the Appointment Slot Issue (ASI) work list to ensure that patients have booked their second onward appointment in a timely manner.\n\n---\n\n[^26]: These data items have been available since Dec 2007, as detailed in DSCN 18/2007 (superseded by ISB 0092 CDS6.2).\n\n[^27]: Defined in DSCN 18/2006.",
